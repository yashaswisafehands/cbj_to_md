### 1. Uterus

### Uterus

You start by the uterus.

**CALL FOR HELP**

**While you wait for helpers do the following:**

* Continuous uterus massage
* Catheterise bladder by inserting a permanent catheter if available to monitor urine output as part of the resuscitation. A normal urine output is 0.5ml/kg per hour.
* If strong bleeding persists – apply bimanual compression and/or aorta compression

When helpers arrive, coordinate:

* Helper 1 at ‘Head’
* Helpers 2 and 3 at ‘Arms’

### Treatment of anaemia after PPH

# Treatment of anaemia after PPH

Check for anaemia and evidence of haemodynamic instability after bleeding has been stopped for 24 hours:

* If there is evidence of haemodynamic instability, arrange for a blood transfusion
* If haemoglobin is less than 7g/dL or haematrocrit is less than 20% (severe anaemia), arrange for blood transfusion AND give oral iron and folic acid.

Give 120 mg iron orally once daily for 3 months plus folic acid 400 mcg orally once daily for 3 months.

After three months, continue supplementation with iron 60 mg orally plus folic acid 400 mcg orally once daily for 3 months

* If haemoglobin is 7-11g/dL, give iron 60 mg orally plus folic acid 400 mcg orally once daily for 3 months.

### Emergency Referral - Post Partum Hemorrhage

### Emergency referral - post partum haemorrage

EMERGENCY!

Do not refer if emergency is not controlled!

Never refer a patient with uncontrolled bleeding, retained placenta or shock.

After emergency management and when in a stable condition, discuss decision of referral with woman and relatives.

Quickly organize transport and possible financial aid.

Inform the referral center.

Accompany the woman and her newborn.

It is crucial that the woman is accompanied by a health worker who is trained in delivery care and able to manage an emergency situation, if it occurs or resurrects during transport.

Consider to bring a relative who can donate blood.

Transfer the baby with the mother.

### During Transport

![](/key learning points/Manual removal of placenta/ambulance)

Observe vital signs and level of consciousness.

In case of excessive vaginal bleeding apply bimanual compression of the uterus.

If the bleeding does not stop apply aorta compression (can be maintained up to 6 hours).

If the woman’s condition permits:

Prevent hypoglycemia and hypothermia of the newborn.

Keep record of all IV fluids, medications given, time of administration and the woman's and newborn's condition.

---

## Procedures

### Urinary catheter

### Urinary catheter - usage

Catheterize only when necessary.   
  
Emptying the bladder with a urinary catheter is indicated:

1. If a woman in labour fails to urinate spontaneously and the progress of labour is dissatisfactory, **OR**
2. Prior to applying vacuum extrator **OR**
3. In cases of postpartum haemorrhage, **AND**
4. In any servere condition such as maternal sepsis or severe preeclampsia/eclampsia to monitor the urine output. In this case, the catheter should stay in place until the condition improves (indwelling urinary catheter).

# Indwelling Urinary Catheter

![](/richtext/urine_catheter)

## Practical information

An indwelling urinary catheter is a catheter that is inserted into the bladder via the urethra and left in the bladder to drain urine.

All women in a critical condition (sepsis, severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, bleeding, shock) must have an indwelling urinary catheter, and the hourly urine output should be at least 30 ml.

If less, the underlying cause should be treated and fluid replacement considered, although not more than 80 ml per hour (oral and IV) should be given for women with preeclampsia as the risk of fluid overload and pulmonary oedema increases.

## Procedure

1. Perform handwashing prior to the procedure and apply gloves.
2. The woman should be lying on her back with knees flexed and thighs relaxed.
3. Place a blanket/sheet to cover the woman as much as possible.
4. If available, cover the woman in sterile drape.
5. Apply sterile gloves.
6. Separate the labia with one hand and expose urethral opening.
7. The area around the urethra should be cleaned twice with gauze swabs and normal saline water.
8. Lubricate catheter.
9. Insert the catheter into the urethral opening.
10. Inflate the balloon slowly by using sterile water to reach the volume recommended on the catheter.
11. **ALWAYS** ensure urine is flowing before inflating the balloon.
12. Pull back the catheter slightly until resistance is felt and attach it to the drainage system with the urine bag.
13. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.

## Removal

1. Explain the procedure to the woman.
2. Ensure privacy and have the woman placed on her back or on a toilet.
3. Perform hand hygiene and put on gloves.
4. Deflate the balloon completely or cut the catheter at the ballon inflation point to ensure the ballon is deflated.
5. Gently pull back the catheter.
6. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
7. Observe urine output after removal of catheter.
8. The woman should urinate spontanously 4-6 hours after the removal.

# Intermittent Urinary Catheter

## Practical Information

Intemittent urinary catheter is inserted at regular intervals or when urination is required but the women is not able to empty the bladder herself.

## Procedure

1. Perform handwashing prior to the procedure.
2. The woman should be lying on her back with knees flexed and thighs relaxed.
3. Place a blanket/sheet to cover the woman as much as possible.
4. If available, cover the woman in sterile drape.
5. Apply sterile gloves.
6. Separate labia with one hand and expose urethral opening.
7. The area around the urethra should be cleaned twice with gauze swabs and normal saline water.
8. Lubricate catheter.
9. Insert catheter into the urethral opening.
10. Empty the womans bladder and remove the catheter.
11. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
12. Note down the urine volume.

### Intravenous access equipment

### Intravenous access - usage

Intravenous access is used to administer fluids and drugs.

Equipment for intravenous access should be located in the delivery room.

It should be available at all health facilities for adults as well as newborn.

It includes:

**Antiseptic solution** to clean the surrounding skin, syringes, intravenous cannulas, a stasis hose/band, tapes, gauze and cannulas.

### Intravenous Access - Practical information

### Adults:

The grey (gauge 16) and green (gauge 18) cannulas have a large diameter.

Using them makes the fluid enter the veines more rapidly.

---

### Newborns:

For insertion of an intravenous cannula in the neonate select a suitable vein to place the cannula or a gauge 21 or 23 butterfly needle.

![](/richtext/pp_iv_baby_english_text)

---

### Peripheral vein:

* Identify an accessible peripheral vein, see illustration.

* An assistant should keep the position of the limb steady and should act as a tourniquet by obstructing the venous return with his or her fingers lightly closed around the limb. Alternatively use a stasis hose/band.

* Clean the surrounding skin with an **antiseptic solution** (such as **spirit**, **iodine**, **isopropyl alcohol** or **70 % alcohol solution**), then introduce the cannula into the vein and insert most of its length. Fix the catheter securely with tape. Apply a splint with the limb in an appropriate position (e.g. elbow extended, wrist slightly flexed).

![](/richtext/pp_iv_baby)

---

### Scalp vein:

These are often used in children under 2 years of age.

* Find a suitable scalp vein (usually in the midline of the forehead, the temporal area or above or behind the ear).

* Shave the area if necessary, and clean the skin with an **antiseptic solution**. The assistant should occlude the vein proximal to the site of puncture. Fill a syringe and leave the end of the tubing open. Introduce the butterfly needle as described above. Blood flowing back slowly through the tubing indicates that the needle is in the vein.

* Care should be taken not to cannulate an artery, which is recognised by palpation. If there is a pulsatile spurting of blood, withdraw the needle and apply pressure until the bleeding stops; then look for the vein.

### Uterine Balloon Tamponade

### Uterine balloon tamponade

UBT content courtesy of Dr. Staffan Bergström.

### Indication Conditions for us

Uterine balloon tamponade technique is indicated when there is profuse uterine bleeding un-stoppable by AMTSL as an attempt to prevent hysterectomy.

### Conditions for use

* The procedure is performed by skilled health personnel who are trained in management of PPH, including the use of UBT
* Other causes of PPH (retained placenta, trauma) have been excluded
* Access to blood products and immediate recourse to surgical intervention is possible, if needed
* A primary PPH first-line treatment protocol (including the use of uterotonics, tranexamic acid, IV fluids) is available and routinely implemented
* Maternal condition can be regularly and adequately monitored for identification of any signs of deterioration

### Tools

* Sterile cloth
* IV-fluids of any kind
* Sterile gloves
* Sterile condom
* IV fluid set (remove the outermost tip of it so there is a little knob)
* Ligature
* Clamp (non traumatic) - minimum 25 cm.
* Headlight
* Two (broad) specula - one down, one up

### How to do it

Stop the bleeding by external compression of the aorta (See Manual Removal of Placenta video).

Keep the fist in position until the uterine tamponade insertion has taken place.

![](/richtext/AC_comdom_balloon_tamponade_mounting)

When mounting the ballon on the plastic tubing; be careful and maintain sterility.

Tie the ligature carefully several times around the balloon below the knob on the plastic tubing.

Tie as tight as possible with reef knot and surgical knotting technique.

### Procedure

Clean the vulva.

Insert the lower most speculum so you can visualize the cervix.

Insert the second speculum anteriorly and place in a similar position.

Unintentional trapping of the vaginal mucosa between the two specula should be avoided, since it is very painful.

Use the long clamp to insert the tubing into the uterus.

Be careful not to grasp the balloon but rather grasp the tubing.

Insert until the balloon disappears into the uterus.

![](/richtext/AC_comdom_balloon_tamponade_insert_1)

Fill the balloon with fluids.

Start with 500 ml.

![](/richtext/AC_comdom_balloon_tamponade_insert_2)

It is normal that the balloon is leaking a little bit (difficult to tie the balloon sufficiently tight to the tubing) – it doesn’t matter.

Continue to fill the balloon until the bleeding stops.

If 500 ml is not enough, infuse more.

You can keep the infusion line open to compensate for any loss due to leaking.

Pack the upper vagina with roller gauze to prevent expulsion of the balloon.

Give **Oxytocin 20 units** in 1 L IV fluids (**Normal Saline** or **Ringer's Lactate**) at **60 drops per minute**.

A single dose of antibiotics is recommended, for example **Ampicillin 2g** IV.

### Post-procedure care

Monitor vital signs, uterine fundal height and vaginal bleeding.

Monitor urine output every hour.

The balloon can be kept inside the uterus for days if transport is needed.

Otherwise, after 6–24 hours, if there is no active vaginal bleeding, deflate the balloon.

If there is no further vaginal bleeding after 30 minutes stop the **Oxytocin**.

If the woman starts to bleed when the balloon is deflated, insert a new balloon and recommence the **Oxytocin** infusion; prepare for surgical interventions when her condition becomes stable.

Remove the urinary catheter once the woman is stable.

### Non-pneumatic anti-shock garment 

# Non-pneumatic anti-shock garment (NASG)

## Usage:

The NASG is a garment that applies pressure to the lower body and abdomen and when fitted correctly, forces blood to the essential organs - heart, lungs, and brain.

It is used for women suffering from uncontrollable PPH and should be applied rapidly to women who are at risk for OR are in shock.

It is a used to control bleeding, reverse shock and stabilize the patient for safe referral.

# Non-pneumatic anti-shock garment

## Steps to apply NASG:

Explain to the woman what you are about to do and why.

* Place the NASG under the woman.
* Close segments 1 tightly around the ankles.
* Close segments 2 tightly around each calf;
* Close segments 3 tightly around each thigh, leave knees free.
* Close segment 4 around pelvis.
* Close segment 5 with pressure ball over the umbilicus
* Finish closing the NASG using segment 6.
* Segments 1,2,3 can be applied by two persons simultaneously, segments 4,5,6 should only be applied by one.

![](/richtext/AC_NASG)

**Remember:**

* When closing the segments -use as much strength as possible while ensuring the woman can breathe normally.
* The NASG should remain on during procedures (including surgery), and must stay on until the source of bleeding is found and corrected.
* Monitor for shortness of breath and decreased urine output.

# Non-pneumatic anti-shock garment

## When to remove NASG:

Remove NASG if for at least 2 hours:

* Pulse is 100 bpm or less
* Systolic BP is 100 or greater
* Bleeding has reduced to normal postpartum rate.
* Confirm pulse and BP immediately before removal.
* Keep IV running
* Begin at ankle segments. Open both and wait for 15 minutes. Take BP and pulse.
* The rule of 20: If pulse does not increase > 20 bpm and if SBP does not decrease more than 20 mmHg, continue opening each segment pair, waiting 15 minutes and checking vital signs before opening next segment.

Remember: If BP or pulse change more than stated above, reclose the NASG. Look for source of bleeding.

# Non-pneumatic anti-shock garment

## Cleaning of the NASG:

To clean the NASG - wear heavy utility gloves.

Use a brush to remove tissue and other material

Prepare a 0.01% bleach solution. At least 30 L of water in a container is needed to cover the NASG.

Decontaminate the NASG by submerging it in the container of bleach and water for 10 minutes.

A brick stone or other heavy object may be placed on the NASG to keep it under water

Wash the NASG with detergent and cool water by hand or in a washing machine.

Squeeze the NASG, especially the ball, to get rid of excess water.

Untangle the NASG and hang it to dry, preferably indoors.

### Lidocaine

# Indication and usage

Lidocaine is a type of local analgesia used for pain relief at deep IM injection with e.g. Magnesium Sulphate and for pain relief prior to suturing or deinfibulation.

Inject the lidocaine in the area where you are going to suture or deinfibulate

# Dosage and administration

## Infiltration

Give 0,5% or 1% with or without adrenaline subcutaneous and/or IM. Maximum dosage is 5 mg/kg.

1 bottle of 20 ml 1 % Lidocaine is equivalent to 200 mg and should be enough for suturing a perineal tear or for deinfibulation.

## Deinfibulation

Give 0,5% or 1% with or without adrenaline percutaneous. Maximum dosage is 5 mg/kg.

## IM Injection

Add 1 ml of 2% lidocaine to the medicine that should be given IM (e.g. Magnesium Sulphate).

Ensure aseptic technique in order to prevent infections and to aspirate when giving the injection in order not to inject directly into a blood vessel.

# Duration of analgesia

The analgesia is efficient 5 minutes after injection  
  
The duration of analgesia is 2 hours.

# Contraindications

Lidocaine is contraindicated in patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to local analgesics.

# Adverse reactions

Side effects with overdose of lidocaine without adrenaline are:  
• Numbness in and around the mouth  
• Swishing sound in the ears  
• Tremors with convulsions  
• Hypotension

Side effects with overdose of lidocaine with adrenaline are based on the side effects from adrenaline:  
• Palpitations  
• Headache   
• Dizziness  
• Drowsiness   
• Chest pain  
• Hypertension  
• Worst case cardiac arrest

At symptoms of overdose, stop treatment, call for help, monitor closely and treat symptoms.

### Misoprostol

# Indications and Usage

Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E1.

Misoprostol is indicated to produce uterine contractions during the third stage of labour and to control postpartum bleeding or haemorrhage.

# Dosage and Administration

For preventing postpartum haemorrhage:

600 mcg (2-3 tablets) orally.

For treatment of postpartum haemorrhage:

800 mcg (4 tablets) sublingually or rectally.   
  
There is a recommendation against using the rectal route for the administration of Misoprostol because the pharmacokinetic profile is not associated with the best efficacy. However, if sublingual administration is not an option due to the woman's condition, recal administration can be considered.

Repeat 200-800 mcg.

Maximum dose: 1600 mcg.

# Contraindications

Prostaglandin allergy.

Prostaglandins should not be given to pregnant women as they cause abortion.
