![](/richtext/AC_signs_of_shock)

---

WARNING

Septic abortion often, but not always, causes fever. A woman with sepsis can have an increased, normal, or low temperature.

---

### Emergency Management

### Emergency management for septic abortion

At signs of septic abortion or at excessive vaginal bleeding evacuation of the uterus must be performed with no delay!

Do not delay by awaiting “antibiotic coverage”.

---

**CALL FOR HELP!**

---

### **Airway**

Position so airway is not occluded or the patient at risk of aspiration.

---

### **Breathing**

If gasping or absent ventilate with bag and mask.

---

### **Circulation**

Insert 2 wide bore IV cannulas.

Give at least **2L fluids** IV, **Normal saline** or **Hartmann's solution** fast.

Insert indwelling urine catheter to monitor in- and output.

---

### **Drugs**

Give antibiotics IV as stated below or according to local guidelines:

**Amoxycillin 1 g/8 hrs**.

AND

**Gentamicin 160 mg/24 hrs.**

AND

**Metronidazole 500 mg/8 hrs.**

---

REMEMBER:

---

This must not delay the lifesaving EVACUATION of the uterus.

Give antibiotics before you start the procedure.

If antibiotics are not available, perform evacuation, give antibiotics as soon as possible afterwards.

---

### **Evacuate the uterus**

Give appropriate analgesia then evacuate using no-touch technique.

Until 12-14 weeks of gestation Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) is the preferred method.

At a higher gestational age evacuation is by Dilatation and Evacuation (D&E) and should be performed in a referral facility.

Sometimes after evacuation of the uterus the woman may bleed heavily (when the uterus has not contracted) therefore **Oxytocin 10 IU** IM may be given.

---

### Monitoring after septic abortion

### Monitoring after septic abortion

1. Monitor vital signs and fluid in-and-output closely until stable.
2. Treat with **IV** **antibiotics** until 48 hours after the woman is fever free, except IV gentamycin which should be continued for 72 hours (3 days), followed by oral antibiotics for 5-7 days.
3. Before discharge, advise on family planning and check for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS.
4. Tell the woman to return in case of not feeling well for example at fever, increasing lower abdominal pain, and at foul smelling discharge.

---

### Emergency Referral - Post Abortion Care

### Emergency referral for post abortion care

Emergency!

Do not refer if emergency is not controlled!

Never refer a patient with uncontrolled bleeding, un-evacuated septic or haemorrhagic abortion or septic shock.

After emergency management and when in a stable condition, discuss decision of referral with woman and relatives.

Quickly organize transport and possible financial aid.

Inform the referral center.

Accompany the woman.

It is crucial that the woman is accompanied by a health worker who is trained in emergency management, if it occurs or resurrects during transport.

Consider to bring a relative who can donate blood.

---

### Bring

Referral note.

## Essential emergency drugs:

* **Oxytocin** and **Ergometrine** (alternatively **Misoprostol**) for treatment of haemorrhage
* **Hydralazine** for IV treatment of elevated blood pressure
* **Amoxycillin**, **Gentamicin** and **Metronidazole** for infections
* **Diazepam** for pain relief

## Supplies:

* IV-equipment + IV fluids

## Procedures

### Cleaning manual vacuum aspirator

### Manual vacuum aspiration - usage

Manual vacuum aspiration, or MVA, is a simple and low cost technique for uterine evacuation.

MVA is used for evacuation of the uterus at incomplete first trimester abortions up to a gestational age of 12-14 weeks.

Especially during septic abortion and strong bleeding in relation to abortion the procedure is a life saving emergency procedure that must be performed without delay.

Ideally antibiotics are given at the start of the procedure, but must not delay it. The procedure can be performed without antibiotics.

### Cleaning manual vacuum aspirator - practical information

![](/richtext/pp_cleaning_1)

---

### Cleaning after use

## Step 1:

Always wear utility gloves and an apron to protect from any splashes.

Immediately after use; discard the cannula and disassemble all items and soak instruments in a solution made of water and the correct concentration of detergent.

Clean items with a tooth brush in the solution.

Do not use bar soap for cleaning items.

If cleaning is not possible immediately, place the items in an empty basket and cover the items with a moist towel until cleaning is possible.

All items should be individually inspected and visibly clean.

Rinse items with clean, running water, and air-dry before sterilisation or high-level disinfection.

## Step 2:

Clean the aspirator thoroughly in warm water and detergent, not soap.

Wear gloves and face protection.

Remove the cannula from the valve by twisting the cannula base and pulling it out.

Grip the wings to aid.

The base of the cannula is permanently attached – do not attempt to remove.

Disassemble the aspirator by pulling the cylinder out of the valve.

Remove the cap by pressing down the cap-release tabs with one hand and pulling off the cap with the other hand.

Open the hinged valve by pulling open the clasp.

Place right thumb alongside the right valve button and left thumb on the valve latch.

With the left thumb, pull up and to the left on the valve latch while pushing down and out on the valve body with the right thumb.

Remove the valve liner.

Disengage the collar stop by sliding it sideways under the retaining clip, or remove the collar stop completely.

Pull the plunger completely out.

Displace the plunger O-ring by squeezing its sides and rolling it into the groove below.

It is not necessary to completely remove it.

### Urinary catheter

### Urinary catheter - usage

Catheterize only when necessary.   
  
Emptying the bladder with a urinary catheter is indicated:

1. If a woman in labour fails to urinate spontaneously and the progress of labour is dissatisfactory, **OR**
2. Prior to applying vacuum extrator **OR**
3. In cases of postpartum haemorrhage, **AND**
4. In any servere condition such as maternal sepsis or severe preeclampsia/eclampsia to monitor the urine output. In this case, the catheter should stay in place until the condition improves (indwelling urinary catheter).

# Indwelling Urinary Catheter

![](/richtext/urine_catheter)

## Practical information

An indwelling urinary catheter is a catheter that is inserted into the bladder via the urethra and left in the bladder to drain urine.

All women in a critical condition (sepsis, severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, bleeding, shock) must have an indwelling urinary catheter, and the hourly urine output should be at least 30 ml.

If less, the underlying cause should be treated and fluid replacement considered, although not more than 80 ml per hour (oral and IV) should be given for women with preeclampsia as the risk of fluid overload and pulmonary oedema increases.

## Procedure

1. Perform handwashing prior to the procedure and apply gloves.
2. The woman should be lying on her back with knees flexed and thighs relaxed.
3. Place a blanket/sheet to cover the woman as much as possible.
4. If available, cover the woman in sterile drape.
5. Apply sterile gloves.
6. Separate the labia with one hand and expose urethral opening.
7. The area around the urethra should be cleaned twice with gauze swabs and normal saline water.
8. Lubricate catheter.
9. Insert the catheter into the urethral opening.
10. Inflate the balloon slowly by using sterile water to reach the volume recommended on the catheter.
11. **ALWAYS** ensure urine is flowing before inflating the balloon.
12. Pull back the catheter slightly until resistance is felt and attach it to the drainage system with the urine bag.
13. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.

## Removal

1. Explain the procedure to the woman.
2. Ensure privacy and have the woman placed on her back or on a toilet.
3. Perform hand hygiene and put on gloves.
4. Deflate the balloon completely or cut the catheter at the ballon inflation point to ensure the ballon is deflated.
5. Gently pull back the catheter.
6. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
7. Observe urine output after removal of catheter.
8. The woman should urinate spontanously 4-6 hours after the removal.

# Intermittent Urinary Catheter

## Practical Information

Intemittent urinary catheter is inserted at regular intervals or when urination is required but the women is not able to empty the bladder herself.

## Procedure

1. Perform handwashing prior to the procedure.
2. The woman should be lying on her back with knees flexed and thighs relaxed.
3. Place a blanket/sheet to cover the woman as much as possible.
4. If available, cover the woman in sterile drape.
5. Apply sterile gloves.
6. Separate labia with one hand and expose urethral opening.
7. The area around the urethra should be cleaned twice with gauze swabs and normal saline water.
8. Lubricate catheter.
9. Insert catheter into the urethral opening.
10. Empty the womans bladder and remove the catheter.
11. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
12. Note down the urine volume.

### Intravenous access equipment

### Intravenous access - usage

Intravenous access is used to administer fluids and drugs.

Equipment for intravenous access should be located in the delivery room.

It should be available at all health facilities for adults as well as newborn.

It includes:

**Antiseptic solution** to clean the surrounding skin, syringes, intravenous cannulas, a stasis hose/band, tapes, gauze and cannulas.

### Intravenous Access - Practical information

### Adults:

The grey (gauge 16) and green (gauge 18) cannulas have a large diameter.

Using them makes the fluid enter the veines more rapidly.

---

### Newborns:

For insertion of an intravenous cannula in the neonate select a suitable vein to place the cannula or a gauge 21 or 23 butterfly needle.

![](/richtext/pp_iv_baby_english_text)

---

### Peripheral vein:

* Identify an accessible peripheral vein, see illustration.

* An assistant should keep the position of the limb steady and should act as a tourniquet by obstructing the venous return with his or her fingers lightly closed around the limb. Alternatively use a stasis hose/band.

* Clean the surrounding skin with an **antiseptic solution** (such as **spirit**, **iodine**, **isopropyl alcohol** or **70 % alcohol solution**), then introduce the cannula into the vein and insert most of its length. Fix the catheter securely with tape. Apply a splint with the limb in an appropriate position (e.g. elbow extended, wrist slightly flexed).

![](/richtext/pp_iv_baby)

---

### Scalp vein:

These are often used in children under 2 years of age.

* Find a suitable scalp vein (usually in the midline of the forehead, the temporal area or above or behind the ear).

* Shave the area if necessary, and clean the skin with an **antiseptic solution**. The assistant should occlude the vein proximal to the site of puncture. Fill a syringe and leave the end of the tubing open. Introduce the butterfly needle as described above. Blood flowing back slowly through the tubing indicates that the needle is in the vein.

* Care should be taken not to cannulate an artery, which is recognised by palpation. If there is a pulsatile spurting of blood, withdraw the needle and apply pressure until the bleeding stops; then look for the vein.
