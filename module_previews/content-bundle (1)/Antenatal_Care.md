# Module: Antenatal Care

## Action Cards

### Respectful Antenatal Care

### Respectful antenatal care

![](/richtext/privacy)

Respectful antenatal care maintains women’s dignity, privacy and confidentiality, ensures freedom from harm and mistreatment and enables informed choice.  
  
Respectful care at every contact, can improve the quality of antenatal care and the women's experience of it.   
  
Respectful care is individualized with provision of relevant and timely information, and psychosocial and emotional support, by practitioners with good clinical and interpersonal skills.   
  
Women that have a positive experience are more likely to attend antenatal care contacts, which can improve their health outcomes.

![](/richtext/screening_for_high_risk)

Screen for high-risk conditions if pathways are in place to treat or reduce their associated risks.  
  
Provide accurate and clear information, using language and methods that can be understood by the women.

* Increase energy and protein intake for women who are undernourished.
* Talk about food taboos and address them if any.
* Restricting coffee: Reduce daily caffeine intake (< 300 mg per day) to reduce the risk of pregnancy loss and low birthweight. Caffeinated products are coffee, tea, cola-type soft drinks, energy drinks, chocolate, caffeine tablets

* Safer sex and use of condoms to prevent STI's.

* Rest and avoid heavy lifting of objects
* NOT to take medications unless prescribed at health centre/ hospital

![](/richtext/avoid_heavy_lifting)

### Violence against women 

### Violence against women

![](/richtext/gender_based_violence)

* Violence against women is any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion, or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.
* Intimate Partner violence (IPV) is any behaviour within an intimate relationship that causes physical, psychological or sexual harm.
* It is a potentially preventable risk factor for various adverse outcomes, including maternal and foetal death.
* You as a health provider have an important role in early identification of women who are experiencing violence and providing appropriate referral and support and thereby improve health outcomes.

![](/richtext/intimate_partner_violence)

### At each contact in the perinatal period, it is important to create a safe and private setting, where you can assess the possibility of violence against the woman.

## Consider asking about IPV if there are signs such as

* a traumatic injury with vague explanations.
* intrusive partner presence at consultations.
* history of adverse reproductive outcomes.
* self-harm, suicidality, symptoms of depression and anxiety.

You should be trained in how to ask about IPV and provide the minimum response.   
  
The setting should be private with confidentiality and appropriate time for disclosure.   
  
A system of referral should be in place.

Antenatal corticosteroid therapy is recommended for women with a high likelihood of preterm birth from 24 weeks to 34+6 weeks of gestation when the following conditions are met:

* Gestational age is accurately known (preferably by ultrasound scan in 1st trimester if available)
* High likelihood of preterm birth within 7 days of first administration
* No maternal infection
* Able to recognise and safely manage preterm labour and birth
* Preterm newborn can receive adequate care including resuscitation, kangaroo mother care, thermal care, feeding support, infection treatment and respiratory support including continuous positive airway pressure as needed.

![](/richtext/corticosteroid_therapy)

Women with preterm membrane rupture without preterm labour, spontaneous preterm labour with intact membranes, or planned preterm birth by induction or caesarean section are given ACT to reduce neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome and systemic infections in preterm newborns by maturing their lungs.

Start ACT, even if you suspect that there is not enough time to complete the course before delivery.

### Medication and Dosage

* **2 doses of 12 mg dexamethasone (IM) given 24 hours apart, OR**
* **2 doses of 12 mg betamethasone (IM) given 24 hours apart.**

Repeat ACT if the woman has already received 1 course of ACT before 7 days and has a high likelihood of giving birth in the next 7 days

For women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and no clinical signs of infection, **prophylactic antibiotics** should be given.

### Tocolytics

![](/richtext/nifedipine)

Nifedipine is recommended for acute and maintenance tocolytic therapy for women with a high likelihood of preterm birth to improve newborn outcomes, **but only if**:

* Spontaneous preterm labour is suspected or diagnosed
* Gestational age is accurately known - between weeks 24+0 and 33+6
* No contraindications of tocolytic use (vaginal bleeding, placental abruption, or intrauterine infection)
* Tocolytic use allows time for ACT to be administered and/or enables transfer of mother to a higher referral facility.
* Adequate birth care is available to recognize and manage preterm labour and birth.
* Women understand the benefits and risks of tocolytics, including uncertainty of long-term health outcomes

## Procedures

### Antenatal Care Checklist 

### Overview

Regular antenatal care throughout the antenatal period improves health outcomes for both women and newborns.

![](/richtext/antenatal_care_checklist)

A minimum of eight antenatal care contacts are recommended by WHO to prevent and identify complications and take appropriate action. Due to difficulties accessing healthcare for women in rural areas, women should receive at least 4, but ideally 8 visits if possible.

Women, who have not given birth by their expected due date, should return for antenatal care at 41 and 42 weeks, or sooner if they experience danger signs.

### Foetal Assessments

### Before performing abdominal examinations

![](/richtext/before_performing_abdominal_examinations_verbal_consent)

* Gain verbal consent
* Allow the woman to empty the bladder
* Lie woman comfortably in a semi-elevated position
* Wash your hands and warm them
* Look for scars
* Ensure uterus is not contracted

### Listen to foetal heart rate (FHR) (from 20 weeks)

![](/richtext/listen_to_foetal_heart_rate)

**Count the FHR for 1 full minute:**

* **110-160 bpm:** Normal
* **<100 bpm or > 1**80 bpm: Indicates asphyxia, refer immediately

### Foetal movements (FM) (from 28 weeks)

![](/richtext/Foetal_movements_2)

* Ask about maternal perception of FM at each contact after 28 weeks
* FM can indicate foetal wellbeing
* Women with reduced or no FMs require additional monitoring

### Feel for number of foetuses (from 30 weeks)

![](/richtext/feel_for_number_of_foetuses)

* Gently palpate the abdomen to identify multiple pregnancies
* Consider a multiple pregnancy if:

- SFH is more than expected  
 - 3 or more foetal poles palpable  
 - Multiple limb clusters palpable.

### Feel for malpresentation (from 35 weeks)

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_The_lie_of_the_fetus)![](/richtext/PP_NLB_The_presenting_part_of_the_fetus)

**Identify foetal:**

* **Lie:** longitudinal, transverse or oblique
* **Position:** direction the foetus is facing
* **Presentation:** cephalic, breech or shoulder
* **Engagement:** presenting part fixed in the pelvis or free. How much of it can you feel?

If the foetus is not cephalic, consult referral hospital for management, inform the woman and prepare an emergency birth plan.

![](/richtext/feel_for_malpresentation)

If the foetus is cephalic and not engaged, inform the woman on the risk of cord prolapse, encourage to attend/contact hospital immediately in the event of ruptured membranes or signs of labour.

**See 'Normal Labour and Birth' module's practical procedures for further information on abdominal examination.**

# Measure symphysial-fundal height (SFH) (from 24 weeks)

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_Measure_the_symphysis_fundus)

* Use both hands to determine the location of the fundus and stabilize it with one hand.
* Measure the distance in cm between the symphysis pubis and the op of the fundus using a measuring tape.

Normal SFH measurements = pregnancy week (+/- 2cm):

* **29cm at 28 weeks:** normal
* **29 cm at 26 weeks:** too big/large for date/multiple pregnancies?
* **29 cm at 33 weeks:** too small/small for date/growth restriction/ oligohydramnios?

You may also use a foetal growth monitoring chart to assess growth:

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_Measure_the_symphysis_fundus_graf)

---

### Routine Maternal Screening and Tests

### Anaemia

Anaemia is blood haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 110g/L which increases the risk of obstetric complications. Look for palmar and conjunctival pallor.

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_Anemia)

**Diagnostic methods** (from most to least accurate)

* Full blood count testing
* Haemoglobinometer
* Haemoglobin colour scale

**Suggested gestations for screening**

* Week 12, 26 and 36 (or when symptomatic)

**If Hb is less than 70g/L, refer to higher centre immediately**

**Treatment**

Increase the woman’s iron dose to 120 mg of elemental iron until her haemoglobin concentration returns to normal (Hb 110 g/L or higher), then resume the standard antenatal doses.   
  
See 'Iron and Folic Acid Supplements' in the Drug List.

### Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (Context specific)

Presence of bacteria in a properly collected urine specimen with no signs or symptoms of urinary tract infection.

**Diagnostic methods** (from most to least accurate)

* Midstream urine culture
* Gram stain test
* Urine dipstick tests

![](/richtext/urine_pregnancy_test)

**Suggested gestations for screening:**  
Week <12, 26 and 34

**Treatment**

A 7-day antibiotic regimen is recommended for all pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria to prevent persistent bacteriuria, preterm birth and low birth weight.   
  
See information on antibiotics in Drug List.

### Gestational Diabetes Mellitus

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is hyperglycaemia first detected in pregnancy and usually disappears after giving birth.

Women with diabetes in pregnancy have more severe hyperglycaemia which does not resolve after pregnancy as it does with GDM.

![](/icon/procedure/diagnosis_2)

**Diagnostic methods**

Follow your local screening strategy. Some settings determine the need for oral glucose tolerance testing by assessing for risk factors. Screening is suggested between 24 and 28 weeks or whenever symptomatic

**Risk factors**

* BMI > 30 kg/m2
* Previous GDM
* Previous macrosomia
* Family history of diabetes mellitus
* Ethnicity with a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus
* Glycosuria on dipstick testing (2+ or above on one occasion, or 1+ on two or more occasions)

### HIV and syphilis

![](/richtext/provider_initiated_testing_and_counselling_pitc)

Where relevant, provider-initiated testing and counselling (PITC) for HIV should be considered a routine part of antenatal care to eliminate mother-to-child HIV transmission.

Integrate HIV testing with syphilis, viral hepatitis or other key tests relevant to your setting. Counsel on safer sex.

![](/richtext/safer_sex_and_use_of_condoms)

If HIV or Syphilis positive, refer for further care.

### Tuberculosis

In settings where tuberculosis (TB) prevalence in the general population is 1 in 1000 or higher, systematic screening for active TB should be considered for pregnant women as part of antenatal care.

![](/richtext/screening_for_tb)

---

### Preventative Management Interventions 

## Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABS)

![](/icon/procedure/antibiotic_regimen_for_ASB)

A seven-day antibiotic regimen is recommended for all pregnant women with ASB to prevent persistent bacteriuria, preterm birth, and low birth weight.  
  
For more information on medication, see Drug List.

**Malaria prevention**

Malaria infection during pregnancy is a major public health problem, with substantial risks for the mother, foetus and the newborn.   
  
In malaria-endemic areas, intermittent preventative treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended for all pregnant women. At least three doses should be given at each antenatal care contact in the second trimester, at least one month apart. Additionally, promote the use of insecticide-treated nets and provide iron and folic acid supplements.

![](/richtext/sulfadoxine_pyrimethamine)

Consider supplying women with their first SP dose at the first ANC visit, instructing them to take it at 13 weeks of gestation.  
  
See Drug List for further information.

**Pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention**

![](/richtext/tenofovir_disoproxil_fumarate)

Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) should be offered as an additional preventive choice for pregnant women who are at substantial risk of HIV infection (when HIV incidence is > 3 per 100 person-years without PrEP).  
  
Individual risk varies depending on individual behaviour and the characteristics of sexual partners. Local evidence of risk factors and HIV incidence should be used to inform implementation.

**Preventative anthelminthic (deworming) treatment**

Preventive deworming treatment is recommended for pregnant women living in endemic areas of helminth infection and where anaemia is a severe public health problem.

![](/key learning points/Antenatal Care/deworming_treatment)

A single dose of albendazole (400mg) or mebendazole (500 mg) is given after the first trimester. In non-endemic areas anthelminthic treatment should be given on a case-to-case basis.

**Tetanus toxoid vaccination**

![](/richtext/tetanus_toxoid_vaccination)

Tetanus toxoid vaccination is recommended for all pregnant women to prevent neonatal mortality from tetanus as the foetus receives maternal antibodies through the placenta.

**Dosage:**

* If not previously immunized, 2 doses should be given one month apart with the second dose at least 2 weeks before delivery. Third dose is given after 6 months of second dose for a five-year protection.
* Two further doses should be given in the 2 subsequent years or subsequent pregnancies.
* A total of 5 doses offer protection during the childbearing years.
* If a woman is already vaccinated in the previous pregnancy, one dose is sufficient.

**Ultrasound Scan (Context specific)**

One ultrasound scan before 24 weeks of gestation (early ultrasound) is recommended to estimate gestational age, detect foetal anomalies and multiple pregnancies, reduce induction of labour for post-term pregnancy, and improve the woman’s pregnancy experience.

![](/richtext/ultrasound_scan)

Offer a late ultrasound scan to pregnant women who have not had an early ultrasound scan, to identifying the number of foetuses, presentation and placental location, , if services are available.

Routine Doppler ultrasound examination is not recommended to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes.

Recommended to all pregnant women as per their previous immunization status with TTCV.   
  
Tetanus vaccination and clean delivery practices are major components of the strategy to eradicate maternal and neonatal tetanus globally.

## Dosage and Administration

1 dose = 0.5ml intramuscularly  
  
**Not been immunized previously or immunization status is unknown**  
  
TTCV 1 - At first contact or as early in pregnancy as possible   
  
TTCV 2 - At least 4 weeks after TTCV1 (at the latest 2 weeks prior to birth)   
  
TTCV 3 - At least 6 months after TTCV2, or during subsequent pregnancy   
  
TTCV 4 - At least 1 year after TTCV3, or during subsequent pregnancy   
  
TTCV 5 - At least 1 year after TTCV4, or during subsequent pregnancy   
Immunized with 1-4 TTCV doses   
  
1 dose of TTCV in subsequent pregnancies up to a total of 5 doses

## Contraindications

If card and/or history confirm that the pregnant woman is fully protected against tetanus (i.e., has received 6 TTCV doses in childhood/adolescence, or 5 doses if first vaccinated after 1 year of age/during adolescence/adulthood, including during previous pregnancies), then no further vaccination is needed.   
  
Vaccination of a “fully protected” pregnant woman should be avoided to prevent the risk of increased local reactions caused by pre-existing high levels of tetanus antibodies.
