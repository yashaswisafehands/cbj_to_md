## Action Cards

### Routine Care

### APGAR Score

Assess the newborn with Apgar score 1, 5 and 10 minutes after birth.

Apgar 7-10: Healthy

Apgar 0-6: Requires medical attention

|  | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Activity | Limp arms and legs | Arms and legs flexed | Active |
| Pulse | Absent | Less than 100 | Above 100 |
| Grimace | No response | Grimace | Sneeze, cough |
| Appearance (skin colour) | Blue or pale | Body pink, arms and legs blue | All pink |
| Respiration | Absent | Slow, irregular | Crying |
| Total score | | | |

### Initial care for all newborns

All newborns need routine care after delivery.

Additional care of low birth weight.

Avoid separating mother from newborn whenever possible and do not leave mother and newborn unattended at any time.

* Assess the newborn immediately after delivery. Start a clock or note down the time.
* At delivery dry and stimulate the newborn. If not crying well or having difficulty breathing proceed to neonatal resuscitation.
* Assess Apgar Score at 1, 5 and 10 minutes.
* Keep warm by skin to skin contact with the mother.
* Monitor the newborn closely.
* Check breathing and colour every 15 min.
* Check the cord for bleeding every 15 min, keep it clean and dry. If bleeding, retie it.
* Give **1 mg** **Vitamin K** (IM). **1 mg** for newborns weighing more than 1500 grams and **0,5 mg** for newborns weighing less than 1500 grams.
* Start breastfeeding within the first hour after birth and let the newborn feed on demand.
* Examine the newborn, look for danger signs.
* Give vaccines according to national protocol.
* Apply Antibiotic Eye Ointment and Chlorhexidine digluconate to the umbilical cord, if relevant to the local context.
* Weigh the newborn, if less than 2.5 kg consider the newborn low birth weight and at risk of complications such as low blood sugar, respiratory distress, and severe infections. Admit and monitor closely for danger signs, consider referral to a facility with advanced care.
* See Low Birth Weight module for further details.
* If clinically stable manage with Kangaroo Mother Care: continuous and prolonged skin-to-skin contact with the mother or another caregiver. Initiate at the hospital and continue at home.

At discharge ask the mother to return if the newborn shows any danger signs.

### Steps for AMTSL

### Steps to prevent post partum haemorrhage

Active management of the third stage helps prevent postpartum hemorrhage.

The most important intervention to reduce post partum haemorrhage is:

**Administration of one of the following uterotonic drugs within one minute after the delivery:**

* **Oxytocin** 10 IU IM/IV

Or

* **Heat-stable Carbetocin** 100 microgram IM/IV.

Or

* **Misoprostol** 400-600 microgram orally.

Active management of third stage of labour may also include:

Delivery of the placenta using **controlled cord traction** with counter-traction above the pubic bone (This intervention is optional in settings where skilled birth attendants are available. It is contraindicated in settings without a skilled birth attendant).

![](/richtext/essential_steps)

Palpation of the uterus after delivery of the placenta to ensure firmness. If not firm/contracted massage the uterus.

## Procedures

### Breastfeeding

### Breastfeeding

Encourage skin-to-skin contact between mother and newborn soon after delivery.

Help the mother to put the newborn to the breast right away.

Start breastfeeding as soon as possible within the first hour after birth.

Check positioning, attachment, and suckling.

Give practical breastfeeding support.

Help the mother with common breastfeeding problems.

Support the mother to breastfeed by:

* Letting the mother and newborn stay together day and night.
* Making sure that mothers of sick newborns can stay near them.

Help the mother know when the newborn is hungry.

Do not limit breastfeeding times.

Feed on demand.

Feed completely on one breast, then shift to the other breast.

---

### Correct attachment

The newborn is well attached to the mother’s breast when:

* Chin is touching the breast.
* Mouth is wide open.
* Lower lip is turned outward.
* More areola is visible above than below the mouth.

---

### Wrong attachment

![](/richtext/AC_breastfeeding_wrong_attachment)

---

Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months; continue breastfeeding for two years.

Support the mother to breastfeed by giving only breastmilk unless there are medical reasons.

Support a mother who wants to formula feed to do so safely.

## Drugs

### Antibiotic Eye Ointment

# Indications and Usage

For prophylaxis of ophthalmia neonatorum due to N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including gonorrhea and chlamydia are a main cause of newborn eye infections (the newborn can get transmitted during delivery).

These infections can cause blindness if not treated.

Give antibiotic eye drops or ointment (e.g. Erythromycin Ophtalmic Ointment) to the newborn to prevent eye infections.

# Dosage and Administration

**For prophylaxis** of neonatal gonococcal or chlamydial ophthalmia, a ribbon of ointment approximately 1 cm in length should be instilled into each lower conjunctival sac.

The ointment should not be flushed from the eye following instillation.

A new tube should be used for each infant.

**For treatment of eye infection:**

Do the following 6-8 times daily:

* Wash hands with clean water and soap.
* Wet clean cloth with boiled and cooled water.
* Use the wet cloth to gently wash off pus from the baby’s eyes.
* Apply 1% tetracycline eye ointment in each eye 3 times daily.
* Wash hands.

# Contraindications

None

# Adverse Reactions

The most frequently reported adverse reactions are minor ocular irritations, redness and hypersensitivity reactions.

### Carbetocin (Heat-Stable)

# Carbetocin (Heat-Stable)

## Indication and usage

Heat-stable Carbetocin is a long-acting synthetic analogue of oxytocin with agonist properties.

Heat-stable Carbetocin injection is indicated to produce uterine contractions during the third stage of labour and is used as an alternative to Oxytocin in Active Management of Third Stage of Labour.

Heat-stable Carbetocin must not be used for labour induction or labour augmentation (i.e. before the delivery of the newborn).

REMEMBER: It is NOT recommended for treatment of postpartum haemorrhage. 

Storage: Heat-stable Carbetocin does not require refrigeration (as opposed to Oxytocin)

## Dosage and administration

Prevention of postpartum haemorrhage (for all women who have given birth):

100 micrograms IM/IV as soon as possible.

## Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to Carbetocin (and Oxytocin).

Never give Carbetocin as IV bolus fast - administer slowly over 1 minute.

Do not give Carbetocin in treatment of Postpartum haemorrhage.

It is only recommended for the prevention of Postpartum haemorrhage in Active Management of Third Stage of Labour.

## Adverse reactions

Common adverse reactions are cardiac arrhythmia, nausea, and vomiting.

---

### Chlorhexidine Digluconate

# Indications and usage

Chlorhexidine gel is used as an antisepsis for the umbilical cord of the newborn.

# Dosage

## Newborns:

7.1% chlorhexidine digluconate dermal gel gives 4% chlorhexidine.

Apply 4% on the umbilical cord stump within 30 minutes after cutting the cord. After waiting for three minutes wrap the baby to prevent hypothermia.

# Precautions

Do not bring into contact with body cavities, eyes (risk of corneal damage), brain and meninges, middle ear (risk of deafness if ear drum is perforated) or mucous membranes, especially to genital mucous membranes.

Do not use with soap or a different type of antiseptic (incompatibility).

# Adverse reactions

Common skin and mucous membrane irritation.

---

### Misoprostol

# Indications and Usage

Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E1.

Misoprostol is indicated to produce uterine contractions during the third stage of labour and to control postpartum bleeding or haemorrhage.

# Dosage and Administration

For preventing postpartum haemorrhage:

600 mcg (2-3 tablets) orally.

For treatment of postpartum haemorrhage:

800 mcg (4 tablets) sublingually or rectally.   
  
There is a recommendation against using the rectal route for the administration of Misoprostol because the pharmacokinetic profile is not associated with the best efficacy. However, if sublingual administration is not an option due to the woman's condition, recal administration can be considered.

Repeat 200-800 mcg.

Maximum dose: 1600 mcg.

# Contraindications

Prostaglandin allergy.

Prostaglandins should not be given to pregnant women as they cause abortion.

# Adverse reactions

One out of three treated with Misoprostol will have diarrhoea or abdominal pain.

It is also common to see a non-allergic rash.

A few will experience a transient moderate increase in temperature.

Some will have nausea, vomiting, constipation or flatulence.

Less common: headache and dizziness is experienced.

Rarely Misoprostol can cause liver damage.

---

### Oxytocin

# Indications and usage

Oxytocin is a pituitary gland hormone.

Oxytocin injection is indicated to produce uterine contractions during the third stage of labor and to control postpartum haemorrhage.

# Dosage and administration

Prevention of postpartum haemorrhage (for all women who have delivered):

10 units (1 ml) of Oxytocin given IM immediately after delivery of the baby.

Treatment of postpartum haemorrhage:

20 IU of Oxytocin added to 1 litre IV fluid (normal saline or Ringer’s lactate). Infuse as fast as possible.

Continuing IV dose:

Infuse 20 units of Oxytocin in 1 litre IV fluids at 40 drops per minute.

Maximum dose:

Not more than 3 litres of IV fluids containing Oxytocin.
