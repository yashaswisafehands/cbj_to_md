# Module: Manual Removal of Placenta

## Action Cards

### Emergency Referral - Manual Removal of Placenta

### Emergency referral for manual removal of placenta

Emergency!

Do not refer if emergency is not controlled!

Never refer a patient with uncontrolled bleeding, retained placenta or shock.

After emergency management and when in a stable condition, discuss decision of referral with woman and relatives.

Quickly organize transport and possible financial aid.

Inform the referral center.

Accompany the woman and her newborn.

It is crucial that the woman is accompanied by a health worker who is able to manage an emergency situation, if it occurs or resurrects during transport.

Consider to bring a relative who can donate blood.

### During Transport

![](/key learning points/Manual removal of placenta/ambulance)

Observe vital signs and level of consciousness.

In case of excessive vaginal bleeding apply bimanual compression of the uterus.

If the bleeding does not stop apply aorta compression (can be maintained up to 6 hours)

If the woman’s condition permits:

Keep record of all IV fluids, medications given, time of administration and the woman´s condition.

---

## Procedures

### Urinary catheter

### Urinary catheter - usage

Catheterize only when necessary.   
  
Emptying the bladder with a urinary catheter is indicated:

1. If a woman in labour fails to urinate spontaneously and the progress of labour is dissatisfactory, **OR**
2. Prior to applying vacuum extrator **OR**
3. In cases of postpartum haemorrhage, **AND**
4. In any servere condition such as maternal sepsis or severe preeclampsia/eclampsia to monitor the urine output. In this case, the catheter should stay in place until the condition improves (indwelling urinary catheter).

# Indwelling Urinary Catheter

![](/richtext/urine_catheter)

## Practical information

An indwelling urinary catheter is a catheter that is inserted into the bladder via the urethra and left in the bladder to drain urine.

All women in a critical condition (sepsis, severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, bleeding, shock) must have an indwelling urinary catheter, and the hourly urine output should be at least 30 ml.

If less, the underlying cause should be treated and fluid replacement considered, although not more than 80 ml per hour (oral and IV) should be given for women with preeclampsia as the risk of fluid overload and pulmonary oedema increases.

## Procedure

1. Perform handwashing prior to the procedure and apply gloves.
2. The woman should be lying on her back with knees flexed and thighs relaxed.
3. Place a blanket/sheet to cover the woman as much as possible.
4. If available, cover the woman in sterile drape.
5. Apply sterile gloves.
6. Separate the labia with one hand and expose urethral opening.
7. The area around the urethra should be cleaned twice with gauze swabs and normal saline water.
8. Lubricate catheter.
9. Insert the catheter into the urethral opening.
10. Inflate the balloon slowly by using sterile water to reach the volume recommended on the catheter.
11. **ALWAYS** ensure urine is flowing before inflating the balloon.
12. Pull back the catheter slightly until resistance is felt and attach it to the drainage system with the urine bag.
13. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.

## Removal

1. Explain the procedure to the woman.
2. Ensure privacy and have the woman placed on her back or on a toilet.
3. Perform hand hygiene and put on gloves.
4. Deflate the balloon completely or cut the catheter at the ballon inflation point to ensure the ballon is deflated.
5. Gently pull back the catheter.
6. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
7. Observe urine output after removal of catheter.
8. The woman should urinate spontanously 4-6 hours after the removal.

# Intermittent Urinary Catheter

## Practical Information

Intemittent urinary catheter is inserted at regular intervals or when urination is required but the women is not able to empty the bladder herself.

## Procedure

1. Perform handwashing prior to the procedure.
2. The woman should be lying on her back with knees flexed and thighs relaxed.
3. Place a blanket/sheet to cover the woman as much as possible.
4. If available, cover the woman in sterile drape.
5. Apply sterile gloves.
6. Separate labia with one hand and expose urethral opening.
7. The area around the urethra should be cleaned twice with gauze swabs and normal saline water.
8. Lubricate catheter.
9. Insert catheter into the urethral opening.
10. Empty the womans bladder and remove the catheter.
11. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
12. Note down the urine volume.

### Intravenous access equipment

### Intravenous access - usage

Intravenous access is used to administer fluids and drugs.

Equipment for intravenous access should be located in the delivery room.

It should be available at all health facilities for adults as well as newborn.

It includes:

**Antiseptic solution** to clean the surrounding skin, syringes, intravenous cannulas, a stasis hose/band, tapes, gauze and cannulas.

### Intravenous Access - Practical information

### Adults:

The grey (gauge 16) and green (gauge 18) cannulas have a large diameter.

Using them makes the fluid enter the veines more rapidly.

---

### Newborns:

For insertion of an intravenous cannula in the neonate select a suitable vein to place the cannula or a gauge 21 or 23 butterfly needle.

![](/richtext/pp_iv_baby_english_text)

---

### Peripheral vein:

* Identify an accessible peripheral vein, see illustration.

* An assistant should keep the position of the limb steady and should act as a tourniquet by obstructing the venous return with his or her fingers lightly closed around the limb. Alternatively use a stasis hose/band.

* Clean the surrounding skin with an **antiseptic solution** (such as **spirit**, **iodine**, **isopropyl alcohol** or **70 % alcohol solution**), then introduce the cannula into the vein and insert most of its length. Fix the catheter securely with tape. Apply a splint with the limb in an appropriate position (e.g. elbow extended, wrist slightly flexed).

![](/richtext/pp_iv_baby)

---

### Scalp vein:

These are often used in children under 2 years of age.

* Find a suitable scalp vein (usually in the midline of the forehead, the temporal area or above or behind the ear).

* Shave the area if necessary, and clean the skin with an **antiseptic solution**. The assistant should occlude the vein proximal to the site of puncture. Fill a syringe and leave the end of the tubing open. Introduce the butterfly needle as described above. Blood flowing back slowly through the tubing indicates that the needle is in the vein.

* Care should be taken not to cannulate an artery, which is recognised by palpation. If there is a pulsatile spurting of blood, withdraw the needle and apply pressure until the bleeding stops; then look for the vein.

### Uterine Balloon Tamponade

### Uterine balloon tamponade

UBT content courtesy of Dr. Staffan Bergström.

### Indication Conditions for us

Uterine balloon tamponade technique is indicated when there is profuse uterine bleeding un-stoppable by AMTSL as an attempt to prevent hysterectomy.

### Conditions for use

* The procedure is performed by skilled health personnel who are trained in management of PPH, including the use of UBT
* Other causes of PPH (retained placenta, trauma) have been excluded
* Access to blood products and immediate recourse to surgical intervention is possible, if needed
* A primary PPH first-line treatment protocol (including the use of uterotonics, tranexamic acid, IV fluids) is available and routinely implemented
* Maternal condition can be regularly and adequately monitored for identification of any signs of deterioration

### Tools

* Sterile cloth
* IV-fluids of any kind
* Sterile gloves
* Sterile condom
* IV fluid set (remove the outermost tip of it so there is a little knob)
* Ligature
* Clamp (non traumatic) - minimum 25 cm.
* Headlight
* Two (broad) specula - one down, one up

### How to do it

Stop the bleeding by external compression of the aorta (See Manual Removal of Placenta video).

Keep the fist in position until the uterine tamponade insertion has taken place.

![](/richtext/AC_comdom_balloon_tamponade_mounting)

When mounting the ballon on the plastic tubing; be careful and maintain sterility.

Tie the ligature carefully several times around the balloon below the knob on the plastic tubing.

Tie as tight as possible with reef knot and surgical knotting technique.

### Procedure

Clean the vulva.

Insert the lower most speculum so you can visualize the cervix.

Insert the second speculum anteriorly and place in a similar position.

Unintentional trapping of the vaginal mucosa between the two specula should be avoided, since it is very painful.

Use the long clamp to insert the tubing into the uterus.

Be careful not to grasp the balloon but rather grasp the tubing.

Insert until the balloon disappears into the uterus.

![](/richtext/AC_comdom_balloon_tamponade_insert_1)

Fill the balloon with fluids.

Start with 500 ml.

![](/richtext/AC_comdom_balloon_tamponade_insert_2)

It is normal that the balloon is leaking a little bit (difficult to tie the balloon sufficiently tight to the tubing) – it doesn’t matter.

Continue to fill the balloon until the bleeding stops.

If 500 ml is not enough, infuse more.

You can keep the infusion line open to compensate for any loss due to leaking.

Pack the upper vagina with roller gauze to prevent expulsion of the balloon.

Give **Oxytocin 20 units** in 1 L IV fluids (**Normal Saline** or **Ringer's Lactate**) at **60 drops per minute**.

A single dose of antibiotics is recommended, for example **Ampicillin 2g** IV.

### Post-procedure care

Monitor vital signs, uterine fundal height and vaginal bleeding.

Monitor urine output every hour.

The balloon can be kept inside the uterus for days if transport is needed.

Otherwise, after 6–24 hours, if there is no active vaginal bleeding, deflate the balloon.

If there is no further vaginal bleeding after 30 minutes stop the **Oxytocin**.

If the woman starts to bleed when the balloon is deflated, insert a new balloon and recommence the **Oxytocin** infusion; prepare for surgical interventions when her condition becomes stable.

Remove the urinary catheter once the woman is stable.

# Dosage and Administration

For preventing postpartum haemorrhage:

600 mcg (2-3 tablets) orally.

For treatment of postpartum haemorrhage:

800 mcg (4 tablets) sublingually or rectally.   
  
There is a recommendation against using the rectal route for the administration of Misoprostol because the pharmacokinetic profile is not associated with the best efficacy. However, if sublingual administration is not an option due to the woman's condition, recal administration can be considered.

Repeat 200-800 mcg.

Rare complications are severe water intoxication which can lead to convulsions and coma and even death, anaphylactic reaction and the loss of clotting factors (fibrinogen) in the blood leading to bleeding complications.

---

### Tranexamic Acid

# Indications and Usage

Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic.

It works by preventing blood clots from breaking down too quickly.

This helps to reduce excessive bleeding.

During childbirth the mother can be injured by a tear in the birth canal.

Most tears are minor and superficial;

they do not require intervention and will heal by themselves.

However, deeper trauma that causes heavy or ongoing bleeding or damage to the perineal muscles needs treatment.

# Dosage and Administration

Administer 1 g Tranexamic Acid in 10 ml diluent per IV over 10 minutes for ongoing bleeding from trauma.

Continuing dose:

Repeat after 30 minutes if bleeding continues.

Maximum dose:

Not more than 10 mg per kg body weight, 3-4 times daily.
