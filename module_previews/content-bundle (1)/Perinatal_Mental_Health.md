### Risk factors/causes

# Risk factors

The biggest predictor is having a pre-existing history of a mental health condition or a strong family history of significant mental health conditions.

Significant risk factors include:

* **Domestic/sexual and gender-based violence**
* **Lack of sleep**
* **Unintended pregnancy** (result of rape, lack of family planning, forced/ early marriage)
* **Women in conflict areas** (state of emergency/ natural disasters, migrants with language and cultural barriers)
* **Lack of social or practical support, financial resources, and access to quality health care**
* **Previous stillbirth, repeated miscarriage**. Globally approximately one in four pregnancies will end in a miscarriage and a further 2.6 million stillbirths occur annually. Perinatal loss is a significant risk factor for women in developing mental health conditions.
* **Traumatic births.** Some women experience birth or pregnancy as traumatic, especially those with a history of childhood sexual abuse. This can lead to PTSD.
* **Poor social determinants of health**
* **Early or forced marriage**
* **Teenage and single mothers**
* **Unemployment**
* **Low levels of education**
* **High domestic workloads**
* **Difficulties with breastfeeding**

### Screening

# Screening

![](/icon/actioncard/screening)

## During the first contact in pregnancy and the postnatal period you should:

Ask the woman about:

* Past or present mental illness
* Severe perinatal mental illness in a first-degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter).
* Domestic violence or other physical abuse

Consider asking the following **depression identification questions** as part of a general discussion about a woman’s mental health and wellbeing:

* During the past month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
* During the past month, have you often been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things?

If a woman responds positively to any of the depression identification questions, you should consider:

* using the **Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale**
* or refer the woman to specialist care

Also consider asking about anxiety using the 2-item **Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale** (GAD-2). See Practical Procedure “Screening tools”.

If a woman scores 3 or more on the GAD-2 consider:

* using the GAD-7 scale OR
* refer the woman to specialist care

Refer to specialist care for assessment and treatment, all women who have or are suspected to have:

* severe mental illness (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, PTSD, and major depression)
* any history of severe mental illness

### Perinatal mental health conditions

# Perinatal depression

![](/richtext/perinatal_depression)

Perinatal depression is a common condition in both the antenatal and postnatal periods. It often co-exists with anxiety.

Women with depression often feel unmotivated to seek treatment as they have a sense of hopelessness and shame about their condition. They may have low levels of depression outside of pregnancy and see it as normal. During pregnancy and postpartum period, the risk of depression increases.

## Prevalence

Estimates state that 1 in 5 women will experience depression in the perinatal period.

## Symptoms

* Low mood
* Periods of weepiness
* Changes in appetite
* Low energy - general fatigue
* Lack of joy & engagement in life
* Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness
* Confusion
* Poor cognitive functioning
* Can be quick to anger
* Difficulties to bond and interact with infant
* Feelings of guilt about mothering ability
* May have thoughts of suicide

## Treatment

* First line management is engaging in a therapeutic relationship with women
* If poor sleep, try to help this problem first
* CBT – talking therapy – empathetic counselling
* Psycho-education – assisting with advising on healthy positive lifestyle choices
* Trauma informed care
* Increased social networks of support
* Repeat the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale to monitor symptoms
* For treatment with medication refer the woman to specialist care

# Anxiety disorders

![](/richtext/AC_tender_uterus)

Most people experience anxiety from time to time. It is a healthy response to stress and can keep us motivated and safe. However, if anxiety becomes severe or prolonged and disrupts daily life activities, it is referred to as an Anxiety Disorder.

Anxiety disorders are common in the perinatal period, and are a group of related conditions that include:

* Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)
* Panic disorder (PD)
* Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
* Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

The common characteristic is a persistent and excessive fear or worry in situations where most people would not be disturbed by.

## Prevalence

20-25% of women experience anxiety in the perinatal period with increased rates leading up to the birth and into the postnatal period.

## Commonalities

Most women will experience anxiety disorders as persistent feelings of stress, fear, worry and lack of ability to control thoughts.

Anxiety disorders also cause a lack of appetite, disturbed sleeping patterns, weepiness, inability to concentrate and short temperedness.

Depression often coexists with anxiety disorders.

## Symptoms

* **General Anxiety Disorder:** Persistent and excessive worry and repetitive negative thoughts that are distracting and create stress and fear for the woman.
* **Panic Disorder:** Extreme fear that results in sudden and recurrent panic attacks. Panic attacks are experienced as a rapid respiratory and heart rate, feeling overwhelmed with terror, unable to control the negative irrational thoughts.
* **Obsessive Compulsive Disorder:** Repetitive, unwelcome thoughts (obsessions) and illogical, extreme urges to perform specific actions. For e.g., a deep fear of germs leading to multiple excessive hand washing.
* **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder:** A previous traumatic birth or any unresolved stressful event may increase the risk of PTSD in the perinatal period. Women may experience flashbacks, nightmares, avoid certain places or people, withdraw socially, feel “numbness” or disconnected to life.

## Treatment

First line management is engaging in a therapeutic relationship with women.

* If poor sleep, try to help this problem first
* CBT – talking therapy – empathetic counselling
* Psycho-education – assisting with advising on healthy positive lifestyle choices
* Trauma informed care for women suffering PTSD – helping them process the shock/ trauma or grief
* Increased social networks of support
* Repeat EPDS to monitor symptoms
* Increased child family health services
* For treatment with medication refer the woman to specialist care

# Bipolar disorder

Bipolar disorder is a rare but serious mental health condition, that should be treated by specialists. It is characterized by extreme mood swings that can last for up to a week or more.

It is usually diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood; however, pregnancy can trigger an initial episode or a relapse.

There are two main categories of bipolar disorder: Manic and Depressive.

Some people with bipolar disorder can swing from the manic state to the depressed state with periods of stability in between. Others may only swing to one category.

## Prevalence

Rates for bipolar are 1-2% of the general population. The perinatal period can cause a relapse of bipolar disorder in 37% of women who have already been diagnosed with the disorder.

If the women are unmedicated the prevalence increases to 66%, however if they remain on medication the rate is 23%.

## Symptoms

* **Manic** - Highly elevated moods, feeling euphoric, often behaving erratically, with rapid speech patterns and requiring little sleep or food. The woman can also be irritable, exhibit poor impulse control and be difficult to reason with. In a severe manic phase, the woman may experience hallucinations or be delusional and hear voices.
* **Depressive** - A very low mood, negative feelings with extreme sadness and an inability to engage in or enjoy daily activities. During this phase of bipolar it is common to have suicidal ideation.

## Treatment

* Psychoeducation
* Cognitive behavioural skills
* Lifestyle adjustments, regular sleep, and routines
* Increased child and family health services
* For treatment with medication refer the woman to specialist care

# Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is a serious, chronic, and complex mental health disorder that causes significant distress and decreased quality of life for sufferers and their families.

People with schizophrenia have increased rates of substance abuse, experience stigma and social isolation.

Pregnancy can increase the symptoms of schizophrenia and trigger a psychotic event and it is crucial that these women are under obstetric and psychiatric care.

## Prevalence

Approximately 1-2% of the population suffer from schizophrenia

## Symptoms

* Disordered thoughts and delusional thinking (false beliefs)
* Hallucinations (usually auditory)
* Lack of insight into behaviours
* Disorganized lifestyle
* Social withdrawal
* Paranoid behaviours- persecution beliefs
* Social anxiety
* Blunt affect
* Lethargy
* Unkempt – inability to care for self
* Abnormal behaviour - mumbling or laughing to self

## Treatment

* Psycho-education- particularly around the need for adequate sleep and nutrition
* Supporting families in providing home care
* Supportive child and family health services
* For treatment with medication refer the woman to specialist care

# Perinatal or puerperal psychosis

Perinatal psychosis is a rare and serious condition requiring urgent referral and almost always immediate hospitalization.

The onset of puerperal psychosis is often unexpected and rapid, usually occurring within 48 hours to 2 weeks of giving birth but may occur up to 12 weeks after the birth.

Women experiencing a perinatal psychosis will become very distressed and be unable to care for their infants. Women with this condition deteriorate rapidly and will need expert medical treatment.

## Prevalence

1:1000 women

This is a very low occurrence however as the condition is so severe it is considered a major concern, in particular for maternal and neonatal mortality.

## Symptoms

* Rapid onset in early postpartum
* Dramatic, erratic behaviour with extreme mood swings
* Distressed by illogical thoughts and fears, often relating to inability to care for the baby
* Hallucinations
* Unable to think rationally or reason with
* Cannot settle or sleep

## Treatment

* Psycho-education- particularly around the need for adequate sleep and nutrition
* Reassurance that the condition can be treated, as it is a very frightening experience for women
* Supportive child and family health services
* Assess risk for infant and mother
* For treatment with medication refer the woman to specialist care.

### Infant outcomes

# Infant outcomes

Infants of mothers who suffer from depression have higher rates of:

* premature births
* low birth weight
* malnutrition and stunting
* diarrheal diseases
* infectious illnesses
* hospital admissions
* reduced completion of immunization schedules.

![](/richtext/rds_newborn)

Additionally, these infants can have a disrupted bonding and attachment process.

This can lead to behavioural issues in infants and in some cases disrupt normal development into adulthood.

Pregnant women who have severe or prolonged states of anxiety have high levels of cortisol in their blood which has a detrimental effect on a foetus’s neurodevelopment. These infants also have an increased risk of developing schizophrenic disorders later in life.

It is therefore important for healthcare workers to observe parenting behaviours and interactions between parents and the infant.

### Violence against women

# Violence against women

Violence against women is defined as "any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life."

Intimate partner (physical, sexual, and psychological) and sexual violence cause serious short- and long-term physical, mental, sexual, and reproductive health problems for women. They also affect their children’s health and wellbeing.

During pregnancy, violence is a potentially preventable risk factor for various adverse outcomes, including maternal and foetal death.

At each contact in the perinatal period, it is important to create a safe and private setting, where you can assess the possibility of violence against the woman.

You as a health provider have an important role in early identification of women and children who are experiencing violence and providing appropriate referral and support.

## Procedures

### Treatment options

# Counselling

All women who present with perinatal mental health issues should be counselled by empathetic, non-judgmental maternity care professionals, offering psychoeducation and trauma informed care.

Whether women require medication for their mental health issues or not, they will benefit from gentle supportive interpersonal counselling from the nurse/midwife/doctor and other allied healthcare workers.

The key principles in perinatal mental health counselling techniques are to explore the behaviours, emotions and ideas that may contribute to the woman’s wellbeing.

Strategies to identify these include:

* **Active, reflective listening** (where you repeat back in your own words what has been said)
* **Motivational interviewing** (where you, in a supportive manner, encourage the woman to talk about her need for change and reasons for wanting to change)

![](/richtext/motivational_interviewing)

# Trauma informed care

Trauma-informed care is a strengths-based framework that acknowledges many people with a mental health condition have experienced severe trauma and may have post-traumatic stress disorder. Therefore, the care delivered must be sensitive to avoid re-traumatising the client.

The guiding principles for clinicians to adapt their practice to trauma informed care include:

* Safety – emotional as well as physical e.g., is the environment welcoming?
* Trust – is the service sensitive to people’s needs?
* Choice – do you provide opportunity for choice?
* Collaboration – do you communicate a sense of 'doing with' rather than 'doing to'?
* Empowerment – is empowering people a key focus?
* Respect for diversity – are you practicing culturally safe care?

# Psychoeducation

The purpose of psychoeducation is to increase a woman’s knowledge and understanding of her perinatal mental health condition and options for treatment.

It is supposed that increased knowledge enables women to cope more effectively with their conditions and take positive steps to improve life choices.

Where possible, psychoeducation should include partners and family members.

![](/richtext/psychoeducation)

Education involves not only information about the condition but useful strategies such as establishing good sleep patterns, maintaining optimum nutrition, alleviating stress and how to interact in relationships in constructive ways.

Empowering women to make positive decisions about their health is pivotal in moving toward self-determination.

# Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)

A type of therapy that may be used with people who have bipolar disorder. It identifies and changes core beliefs and behaviours that underlie inaccurate perceptions. CBT may reduce mood and anxiety symptoms and may reduce self-harming behaviour.

CBT aims to:

1. Teach skills to deal with intrusive negative thoughts
2. Rebuild self-esteem and self-identity
3. Improve acute symptoms by assisting to reframe the thought patterns that are disturbing. This might happen through talking about the trauma or concentrating on where the fears come from.

# Psychological first aid

The three basic action principles of PFA are:

1. Look: Checking that the woman is safe
2. Listen: Ask about the woman’s concerns and listen calmly
3. Link: Help the woman address her basic needs by accessing services for her

PFA involves the following actions:

* providing practical care and support, which does not intrude
* assessing needs and concerns
* helping people to address basic needs (for example, food and water, information)
* listening to people, but not pressuring them to talk
* comforting people and helping them to feel calm
* helping people connect to information, services, and social supports
* protecting people from further harm.

### Caring for the carer

# Caring for the carer

Providing care for women experiencing perinatal mental health conditions can be stressful and worrying for maternity care providers.

Emotional exhaustion and burn-out is not uncommon in the nursing and midwifery professions.

Professional support in the form of de-briefing, clinical supervision and mentoring are strategies that can assist healthcare providers process stressful clinical scenarios.

Self-care techniques such as healthy lifestyle choices, regular exercise, nutritious food, adequate sleep and partaking in social activities are all ways that can help with work-life balance.

Seeking professional support or counselling is recommended for maternity care providers who feel overwhelmed or burdened by their caseload.

### Screening tools

# The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale

This is a simple, effective tool used to screen for perinatal depression and anxiety. Despite its name, it is also used as a screening tool in the antenatal period.

It is a 10 item self-reported questionnaire that should be collected at the first point of contact in the maternity care setting.

Women are asked to report on how they have been feeling in the last 7 days and are scored on each item. A total score is calculated based on the scoring system. The score will indicate the woman’s level of psychological distress.

Reassure the woman that the information will be kept private and confidential.

**A score of 13 and over warrants further attention.**

If the score is not much higher than 13, you should conduct a repeat screen at the next visit

If the score is significant, or higher signs or risk factors for PMH are present, this indicates the need for referral to specialist care

Many women under-report their stress levels. It is therefore important to use screening tools together with history taking and clinical judgment.

![](/richtext/screening_tools)

## Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2)

The GAD-2 is an ultra brief and easy to perform initial screening tool for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).

A score of 3 points is the preferred cut-off for identifying possible cases and in which further diagnostic evaluation for generalized anxiety disorder is warranted.

![](/icon/actioncard/Generalized_Anxiety_Disorder_Scale_(GAD-2))

# Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7)

The GAD-7 score is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response categories of “not at all,” “several days,” “more than half the days,” and “nearly every day,” respectively, and then adding together the scores for the seven questions.

Scores of 5, 10, and 15 represent cut-points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively.

When used as a screening tool, further evaluation is recommended when the score is 10 or greater.
