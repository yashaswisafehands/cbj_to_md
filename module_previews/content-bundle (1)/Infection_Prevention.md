## Procedures

### Mixing alcohol-based handrub

### Mixing alcohol-based handrub - usage

Using alcohol-based handrub is indicated when hands are visibly clean.

Use alcohol-based handrub before and after every procedure, such as before and after touching a patient, after touching patient's surroundings, before a clean procedure, after body fluid exposure risk including after using toilet and before and after wearing gloves.

### Note:

* **Glycerol:** used as humectant, but other emollients may be used for skin care, provided that they are cheap, widely available and miscible in the water and alcohol and do not add to toxicity, or promote allergy.

* **Hydrogen peroxide:** used to inactivate contaminating bacterial spores in the solution and is not an active substance for hand antisepsis.

* Any further additive should be clearly labelled and be non-toxic in case of accidental ingestion.

* A colourant may be added to allow differentiation from other fluids, but should not add to toxicity, promote allergy, or interfere with antimicrobial properties. The addition of perfumes or dyes is not recommended due to risk of allergic reactions.

### Step by step preparation:

**1.** The alcohol (**Ethanol** or **Isopropyl**) for the formula to be used is poured into the large bottle or tank up to the graduated mark.

![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_method_1)

**2. Hydrogen peroxide** is added using the measuring cylinder.

![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_method_2)

**3. Glycerol** is added using a measuring cylinder.

As **glycerol** is very viscous and sticks to the wall of the measuring cylinder, it should be rinsed with some sterile distilled or cold boiled water and then emptied into the bottle/tank.

![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_method_3)

**4.** The bottle/tank is then topped up to the 10-litre mark with sterile distilled or cold boiled water.

**5.** The lid or the screw cap is placed on the tank/bottle as soon as possible after preparation, in order to prevent evaporation.

![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_method_4)

**6.** The solution is mixed by shaking gently where appropriate or by using a paddle.

![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_method_5)

**7.** Immediately divide up the solution into its final containers (e.g. 500 or 100 ml plastic bottles), and place the bottles in quarantine for 72 hours before use.

This allows time for any spores present in the alcohol or the new/re-used bottles to be destroyed.

![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_method_6)

### Mixing alcohol-based handrub - quality control

**1.**  Pre-production analysis should be made every time an analysis certificate is not available to guarantee the titration of alcohol (i.e. local production).

Verify the alcohol concentration with the alcoholmeter and make the necessary adjustments in volume in the preparation formulation to obtain the final recommended concentration.

![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_quality_1)![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_quality_2)

**2.**  Post-production analysis is mandatory if either **ethanol** or an **isopropanol solution** is used.

Use the alcoholmeter to control the alcohol concentration of the final use solution.

The accepted limits should be fixed to **± 5%** of the target concentration (**75%–85% for ethanol**).

![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_quality_3)

**3.** The alcoholmeter shown in the image above is for use with **ethanol**; if used to control an **isopropanol solution**, a **75%** solution will show **77% (± 1%)** on the scale at 25°C.

### Mixing alcohol-based handrub - general information

Labelling should be in accordance with national guidelines and should include the following:

* Name of institution, date of production and batch number.
* WHO-recommended hand rub formulation.
* For external use only.
* Avoid contact with eyes.
* Keep out of reach of children.
* Date of production and batch number.
* Use: Apply a palmful of alcohol-based handrub and cover all surfaces of the hands. Rub hands for 30 seconds.
* Composition: **Ethanol** or **isopropanol**, **glycerol** and **hydrogen peroxide**.
* Flammable: Keep away from flame and heat.

### Mixing alcohol-based handrub - production and storage

* Production and storage facilities should ideally be air conditioned or cool rooms. No naked flames or smoking should be permitted in these areas.

* WHO-recommended handrub formulations should not be produced in quantities exceeding 50- litres locally or in central pharmacies lacking specialised air conditioning and ventilation.

* Since undiluted ethanol is highly flammable and may ignite at temperatures as low as 10°C, production facilities should directly dilute it to the above mentioned concentration.

* The flashpoints of **ethanol 80%** (v/v) and of **isopropyl alcohol 75%** (v/v) are 17.5°C and 19°C, respectively.

* National safety guidelines and local legal requirements must be adhered to the storage of ingredients and the final product.

## Drugs

### Post Exposure Prophylaxis - PEP

# Preamble

PEP is Post-Exposure Prophylaxis.

It means taking antiretroviral medicines (ART) after being potentially exposed to HIV to prevent becoming infected.

# Indications and Usage

PEP should be considered if you have had a recent possible exposure to HIV at work.

Report your exposure to your supervisor, and seek medical attention immediately.

Occupational transmission of HIV to health care workers is extremely rare, and the proper use of safety devices and barriers can help minimize the risk of exposure while caring for patients with HIV.

# Dosage and Administration

PEP must be started within 72 hours after a recent possible exposure to HIV, but the sooner you start the PEP, the better.

Every hour counts.

If you're prescribed PEP, you'll need to take it once or twice daily for 28 days.

PEP is effective in preventing HIV when administered correctly, but not 100%.

PEP normally consists of 3 anti-HIV drugs, from 2 of the different classes.

(A regimen for post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV with 2 ARV drugs is effective, but 3 drugs are preferred).

TDF + 3TC (or FTC) + EFV as a fixed-dose combination is recommended as the preferred option to initiate ART for adults and adolescents.

Remember to take an HIV test 3 months after exposure.

Pregnant and breastfeeding women can be treated with PEP.

# Contraindications

Do not treat pregnant women with Efavirenz or Nevirapin.

# Adverse Reactions

HIV treatment can cause side-effects which tend to be the worst when you first start taking them.

If you are taking PEP you may experience some unpleasant side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches and fatigue.

The drugs used in a course of PEP today are less likely to cause side-effects than those used in the past.
