# Module: Normal Labour and Birth

## Procedures

### Initial assessment

# Initial assessment

When a labouring woman comes for care at your health facility you should perform a quick and initial assessment of the woman and the fetus.

## Examine for danger signs

Examine for danger signs such as:

* Severe headache/blurred vision
* Fever
* Bleeding
* Severe abdominal pain
* Premature rupture of membranes.

![](/richtext/AC_tender_uterus)

## Check vital signs

Check that vital signs are within normal range:

* Temperature: ≤ 38 °C
* Maternal pulse: 60-110 bpm
* Systolic BP: 90-139 mmHg
* Diastolic BP: 60-89 mmHg

![](/icon/module/hypertension_alt)

## Look for signs of anemia and dehydration:

**Anemia:**

* Look for paleness inside the conjunctiva/eyelids and palms

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_Anemia)

**Dehydration:**

* Look for sunken eyes and dry mouth
* Pinch the skin of her forearm to see if it goes back quickly

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_Initial_Dehydration)

## Review medical records

Evaluate HIV and Hepatitis B status, status of STIs, TB, GDM, FGM and other conditions, which require special considerations during labour and birth.

## Take a complete history

* Ask about her medical history
* Ask about past and current pregnancies

### Calculate due date and GA 

# Calculate due date and GA

Ask the woman for the first day of her last menstrual period (LMP) and if possible, confirm with the ANC record.

**Calculate her expected date of delivery (EDD):**

* First day of LMP + 7 days - 3 months OR First day of LMP + 7 days + 9 months
* Example: Last menstrual period started on March 1 + 7 days is March 8. Then if you subtract 3 months OR add 9 months it gives a due date of December 8.

---

**Calculate her gestational age (GA):**

* Use a pregnancy wheel or mobile app OR
* Count the weeks on a calendar between today and the EDD and subtract from 40.
* Example: Today is November 17. The estimated due date is December 8. There are 3 weeks between today and the estimated due date. 40 – 3 = 37. The gestational age is therefore 37+0.

### Abdominal examination 

# Measure the symphysis-fundus (SF) height

Make sure the bladder is empty.

The woman should lie comfortably on her back.

Look for scars (from previous cesarean sections or other operations).

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_Measure_the_symphysis_fundus)

* Palpate the abdomen with one hand to determine the height of the fundus of the uterus
* Hold one end of the tape measure at the top of the symphysis pubis and measure the distance from the symphysis pubis and the top of the fundus (in centimeters).
* For fetuses growing normally, from 24 weeks of gestation, the SF measurement in centimeters should correspond to the number of weeks of gestation, with an allowance of a 2-cm difference either way.

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_Measure_the_symphysis_fundus_graf)

# Palpation of the fetus

There are four steps for palpating the fetus. These should be performed systematically.

## 1. The lie of the fetus:

This may be longitudinal, transverse or oblique. Place both hands on the abdomen and let them glide along the uterus to determine the lie of the fetus.

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_The_lie_of_the_fetus)

## 2. Which part is present at the top of the uterus?

Palpate the fundus with the fingers of both hands in order to discover which part of the fetus is present (breech or head). The head feels hard and round and is easily movable and ballotable. The breech feels soft, triangular and continuous with the body.

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_Which_part_is_present_at_the_top_of_the_uterus)

## 3. The position of the back of the fetus:

Place one hand on each side of the abdomen. With one hand you give small pushes against the uterus while the other hand provides counterpressure. You will now be able to feel where the back of the fetus is.

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_The_position_of_the_back_of_the_fetus)

## 4. The presenting part of the fetus:

Grasp the lower portion of the abdomen just above the symphysis pubis to feel for the presenting part of the fetus and to decide if the presenting part is loose above the pelvis or fixed in the pelvis.

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_The_presenting_part_of_the_fetus)

As you are palpating the fetus, remember to assess the size of the fetus itself. Does the fetus have the size you would expect for the size of the uterus and the duration of the pregnancy?

If any of your findings are abnormal and you suspect things like a multiple pregnancy or intra-uterine growth restriction due to a small SF measurement, the woman should have an ultrasound examination if possible.

It is also important to ask the woman if she is feeling fetal movements as usual.

# Contractions

You should note down frequency, duration and intensity of the contractions as well as how the woman is coping.

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_Contractions)

1. Place a hand on the abdomen to feel when the contractions start and end. Take the time at the beginning and end of the contractions.
2. Note down the length, frequency and intensity of the contractions that occur in a period of 10 minutes.

In the first stage of the active phase there will be regular painful contractions lasting about 45-60 seconds each with 3-5 minutes in between. This means 2-3 contractions in 10 minutes.

As labour progresses contractions will intensify and last about 60-90 seconds each with a 30 second- 2-minute rest in between.

### Foetal heart rate

### Foetal heart rate - usage

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_Monitoring)

Measurement of the foetal heart rate at birth is indicated:

**1)** On admission,

**2)** During the 1st stage of labour: Every **30 minutes** for mothers and foetuses at low risk, and every **15 minutes** if any risk is identified for the mother or foetus.

**3)** During 2nd stage: Immediately after every contraction and at least every **5 minutes.**

### Foetal heart rate - normal values

The lower limit for a normal foetal heart rate is defined as 110 beats per minute (bpm).

A heart rate below 100 bpm indicates foetal asphyxia and immediate delivery is necessary.

The upper limit for a normal heart rate is 160 bpm.

A heart rate above 180 bpm indicates foetal asphyxia and immediate delivery is necessary.

### Foetal heart rate - practical information

The foetal heart is best heard by placing the foetoscope over the back of the foetus. You should therefore establish the lie and position of the foetus before listening to the foetal heart.

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_The_position_of_the_back_of_the_fetus)

Always measure the foetal heart rate for one minute immediately after a contraction (you will need a watch).

Measuring the maternal pulse and the foetal heart rate simultaneously can help avoid a mix-up between the two.

### Vaginal examination

# Vaginal examination

A vaginal examination helps determine stage of labour, fetal presentation and position, and membrane status.

They should be done gently and respectfully and in communication with the woman to reduce fear and pain.

* Vaginal examinations should be performed at intervals of 4 hours
* Frequent vaginal examinations increase the risk of infection.
* Always gain consent, wash hands, and wear sterile gloves.
* Do not do a vaginal examination during a contraction
* Make sure the bladder is empty
* Ask the woman to relax her legs
* Clean vulva with clean water
* Check color and odor of any fluid (Is it clear or meconium stained?)

Gently insert two fingers into vagina to check:

* Cervix: Where is it? How soft, and dilated is it? Has the dilatation changed since last vaginal examination?
* Presenting part & position: Is the head the presenting part and what is the position of the baby?
* Bleeding: Is there any vaginal bleeding? How does it look?

Remove gloves, wash hands and note down your findings.

### Monitoring 

# Monitoring

Careful monitoring is the only way to know if labour is progressing and if the woman and her baby are doing well.

Remember to continuously check the woman’s mood and behavior.

**In the latent phase**

Every four hours:

* Check blood pressure, pulse and temperature

**In the 1st stage – active phase**

Every 30 minutes:

* Listen to the FHR in between contractions
* Monitor contractions
* Count the woman’s pulse

Every 4 hours:

* Measure vital signs
* Perform vaginal examination

**In the 2nd stage**

Every 5 minutes:

* Monitor the FHR
* Monitor contractions
* Visually check for descent of the fetus

## Drugs

### Carbetocin (Heat-Stable)

# Carbetocin (Heat-Stable)

## Indication and usage

Heat-stable Carbetocin is a long-acting synthetic analogue of oxytocin with agonist properties.

Heat-stable Carbetocin injection is indicated to produce uterine contractions during the third stage of labour and is used as an alternative to Oxytocin in Active Management of Third Stage of Labour.

Heat-stable Carbetocin must not be used for labour induction or labour augmentation (i.e. before the delivery of the newborn).

REMEMBER: It is NOT recommended for treatment of postpartum haemorrhage. 

Storage: Heat-stable Carbetocin does not require refrigeration (as opposed to Oxytocin)

## Dosage and administration

Prevention of postpartum haemorrhage (for all women who have given birth):

100 micrograms IM/IV as soon as possible.

## Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to Carbetocin (and Oxytocin).

Never give Carbetocin as IV bolus fast - administer slowly over 1 minute.

Do not give Carbetocin in treatment of Postpartum haemorrhage.

It is only recommended for the prevention of Postpartum haemorrhage in Active Management of Third Stage of Labour.

## Adverse reactions

Common adverse reactions are cardiac arrhythmia, nausea, and vomiting.

---

### Misoprostol

# Indications and Usage

Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E1.

Misoprostol is indicated to produce uterine contractions during the third stage of labour and to control postpartum bleeding or haemorrhage.

# Dosage and Administration

For preventing postpartum haemorrhage:

600 mcg (2-3 tablets) orally.

For treatment of postpartum haemorrhage:

800 mcg (4 tablets) sublingually or rectally.   
  
There is a recommendation against using the rectal route for the administration of Misoprostol because the pharmacokinetic profile is not associated with the best efficacy. However, if sublingual administration is not an option due to the woman's condition, recal administration can be considered.

Repeat 200-800 mcg.

Maximum dose: 1600 mcg.

# Contraindications

Prostaglandin allergy.

Prostaglandins should not be given to pregnant women as they cause abortion.

# Adverse reactions

One out of three treated with Misoprostol will have diarrhoea or abdominal pain.

It is also common to see a non-allergic rash.

A few will experience a transient moderate increase in temperature.

Some will have nausea, vomiting, constipation or flatulence.

Less common: headache and dizziness is experienced.

Rarely Misoprostol can cause liver damage.

---

### Oxytocin

# Indications and usage

Oxytocin is a pituitary gland hormone.

Oxytocin injection is indicated to produce uterine contractions during the third stage of labor and to control postpartum haemorrhage.

# Dosage and administration

Prevention of postpartum haemorrhage (for all women who have delivered):

10 units (1 ml) of Oxytocin given IM immediately after delivery of the baby.

Treatment of postpartum haemorrhage:

20 IU of Oxytocin added to 1 litre IV fluid (normal saline or Ringer’s lactate). Infuse as fast as possible.

Continuing IV dose:

Infuse 20 units of Oxytocin in 1 litre IV fluids at 40 drops per minute.

Maximum dose:

Not more than 3 litres of IV fluids containing Oxytocin.

---

Store Oxytocin at a temperature between 2 and 8°C.

# Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to Oxytocin.

# Adverse reactions

Common adverse reactions are cardiac arrhythmia, nausea, and vomiting.

Rare complications are severe water intoxication which can lead to convulsions and coma and even death, anaphylactic reaction and the loss of clotting factors (fibrinogen) in the blood leading to bleeding complications.
