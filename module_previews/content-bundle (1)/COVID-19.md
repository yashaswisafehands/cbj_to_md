# Module: COVID-19

## Action Cards

### Antenatal Care 

# Facility-based Antenatal Care

All women and their companion should be triaged and screened for symptoms of COVID-19 before entering the health facility.

Women should be encouraged to wait outside or in designated, marked areas that show where to stand for ANC.

They should maintain social distancing of 2 arms lengths wherever possible.

Restrict attendance for ANC visits to include only the woman (and an asymptomatic companion of choice if allowed).

Continue physical contact and clinical examination as normal during ANC visits but pay extra attention to infection control measures for both the woman and the midwife.

## For women with symptoms of COVID-19:

* If the woman is in home isolation, the ANC appointment should be rebooked for after the isolation period ends.
* If the woman is experiencing any pregnancy related complications she needs to be seen separately from others in an isolated room if possible.
* Women with symptoms need to wear a face mask and maternity care providers should wear the recommended PPE.

## Hand hygiene

All women and their companion need to perform hand hygiene:

* When arriving to waiting area
* When entering clinical rooms
* When leaving clinical rooms
* When leaving clinic

Maternity care providers need to perform hand hygiene:

* Before every new woman is seen
* Before physical examination
* Immediately after examination
* When the woman leaves
* After cleaning surfaces between every patient contact
* After coughing or sneezing

## ANC schedule

Wherever possible the current WHO schedule of eight ANC contacts should be provided and maintained.

Where technology and services are available, some of these contacts may be a remote ANC contact (provided by phone, via WhatsApp, Skype or Facetime).

This may be appropriate for some women after risk assessment and can be used for appointments where the woman does not require physical clinical assessments and/or tests.

The schedule below offers guidance on which contacts might best be undertaken face-to-face and which might suit a remote contact.

1. 12 weeks: Face-to-face
2. 20 weeks: Remote contact
3. 26 weeks: Remote contact
4. 30 weeks: Face-to-face
5. 34 weeks: Remote contact
6. 36 weeks: Face-to-face
7. 38 weeks: Remote contact
8. 40 weeks: Face-to-face

---

### Note:

* **Glycerol:** used as humectant, but other emollients may be used for skin care, provided that they are cheap, widely available and miscible in the water and alcohol and do not add to toxicity, or promote allergy.

* **Hydrogen peroxide:** used to inactivate contaminating bacterial spores in the solution and is not an active substance for hand antisepsis.

* Any further additive should be clearly labelled and be non-toxic in case of accidental ingestion.

* A colourant may be added to allow differentiation from other fluids, but should not add to toxicity, promote allergy, or interfere with antimicrobial properties. The addition of perfumes or dyes is not recommended due to risk of allergic reactions.

### Mixing alcohol-based handrub - Method

### 10-litre preparations:

These can be prepared in 10-litre glass or plastic bottles with screw-treaded stoppers.

---

### Step by step preparation:

**1.** The alcohol (**Ethanol** or **Isopropyl**) for the formula to be used is poured into the large bottle or tank up to the graduated mark.

![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_method_1)

**2. Hydrogen peroxide** is added using the measuring cylinder.

![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_method_2)

**3. Glycerol** is added using a measuring cylinder.

As **glycerol** is very viscous and sticks to the wall of the measuring cylinder, it should be rinsed with some sterile distilled or cold boiled water and then emptied into the bottle/tank.

![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_method_3)

**4.** The bottle/tank is then topped up to the 10-litre mark with sterile distilled or cold boiled water.

**5.** The lid or the screw cap is placed on the tank/bottle as soon as possible after preparation, in order to prevent evaporation.

![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_method_4)

**6.** The solution is mixed by shaking gently where appropriate or by using a paddle.

![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_method_5)

**7.** Immediately divide up the solution into its final containers (e.g. 500 or 100 ml plastic bottles), and place the bottles in quarantine for 72 hours before use.

This allows time for any spores present in the alcohol or the new/re-used bottles to be destroyed.

![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_method_6)

### Mixing alcohol-based handrub - quality control

**1.**  Pre-production analysis should be made every time an analysis certificate is not available to guarantee the titration of alcohol (i.e. local production).

Verify the alcohol concentration with the alcoholmeter and make the necessary adjustments in volume in the preparation formulation to obtain the final recommended concentration.

![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_quality_1)![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_quality_2)

**2.**  Post-production analysis is mandatory if either **ethanol** or an **isopropanol solution** is used.

Use the alcoholmeter to control the alcohol concentration of the final use solution.

The accepted limits should be fixed to **± 5%** of the target concentration (**75%–85% for ethanol**).

![](/richtext/pp_mixing_handrub_quality_3)

**3.** The alcoholmeter shown in the image above is for use with **ethanol**; if used to control an **isopropanol solution**, a **75%** solution will show **77% (± 1%)** on the scale at 25°C.

### Mixing alcohol-based handrub - general information

Labelling should be in accordance with national guidelines and should include the following:

* Name of institution, date of production and batch number.
* WHO-recommended hand rub formulation.
* For external use only.
* Avoid contact with eyes.
* Keep out of reach of children.
* Date of production and batch number.
* Use: Apply a palmful of alcohol-based handrub and cover all surfaces of the hands. Rub hands for 30 seconds.
* Composition: **Ethanol** or **isopropanol**, **glycerol** and **hydrogen peroxide**.
* Flammable: Keep away from flame and heat.

### Mixing alcohol-based handrub - production and storage

* Production and storage facilities should ideally be air conditioned or cool rooms. No naked flames or smoking should be permitted in these areas.

* WHO-recommended handrub formulations should not be produced in quantities exceeding 50- litres locally or in central pharmacies lacking specialised air conditioning and ventilation.

* Since undiluted ethanol is highly flammable and may ignite at temperatures as low as 10°C, production facilities should directly dilute it to the above mentioned concentration.

* The flashpoints of **ethanol 80%** (v/v) and of **isopropyl alcohol 75%** (v/v) are 17.5°C and 19°C, respectively.

* National safety guidelines and local legal requirements must be adhered to the storage of ingredients and the final product.

### Minimize the spread of COVID-19 at the health facility

### Minimize the spread of COVID-19 at the health facility

## Managing placement

* Have a triage station at the facility entrance prior to any waiting area to screen patients for COVID-19
* Immediately isolate suspected and confirmed cases
* Offer a mask to suspected cases
* To reduce stress and anxiety, explain to patients what you do and why you do it
* If possible, place patients in single rooms
* Keep suspected and confirmed cases separate
* Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between patients



## Managing the environment

* Limit movement of the patient
* Perform regular cleaning
* Maintain good ventilation by opening windows and doors

## Managing visitors

* Limit the number of visitors
* All visitors should wear the required Personal Protective Equipment

## Managing how to put on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

* Put on gown
* Put on medical mask and eye protection (e.g. googles or face shield)
* Put on gloves over cuff
* If performing an aerosol-generating procedure (e.g. intubation or resuscitation), a respirator (E.g. EU FFP2 or equivalent respirator) should be used instead of a medical mask.

## Managing how to take off PPE

* Do not use the same PPE for different patients
* Do not step into a clean area wearing contaminated PPE

**Remove all PPE before exiting the patient’s room in the following order:**

1. Gown and gloves (Peel off gown and gloves and roll inside out. Dispose safely in a waste container. Separate containers should be available for reusable items)
2. Perform hand hygiene
3. Goggles or face shield (Remove from the back by lifting head band or earpieces. If the item is reusable place it in the designated container for reprocessing)
4. Mask (Do not touch the front of the mask. Remove by grasping bottom ties of the mask and discard in a waste container)
5. Perform hand hygiene immediately after removing PPE.

**In the view of PPE shortage at the health facility:**

* Bundle activities to minimize the number of times a room is entered (e.g. check vital signs during medication administration).
* Use physical barriers to reduce exposure to the COVID-19 virus, such as glass or plastic windows (e.g. at the registration desk at the emergency department).

### Symptoms of COVID-19

### Symptoms of COVID-19

COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and most infected people will develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without requiring special treatment.

The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days

Common symptoms of COVID-19 include:

* Fever ≥38°C
* Tiredness
* Dry cough

Other symptoms are:

* Sore throat
* Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
* Aches and pains
* Few people report diarrhea, nausea or a runny nose

WHO recommends that pregnant women with symptoms of COVID-19 should be prioritized for testing. If they have COVID-19, they may need specialized care.

### Are Pregnant Women an ‘At Risk’ Group? 

### Are Pregnant Women an ‘At Risk’ Group?

Pregnant women or recently pregnant women who are older, overweight, and have pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes seem to have an increased  risk of developing severe COVID-19. 

When pregnant women develop severe disease, they also seem to more often require care in intensive care units than non-pregnant women of reproductive age.

Due to changes in their bodies and immune systems, we know that pregnant women can be badly affected by some respiratory infections.

It is therefore important that they take precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, and report possible symptoms (including fever, cough or difficulty in breathing) to their healthcare provider.

### Vertical Transmission and Newborn Risk 

### Vertical Transmission and Newborn Risk

We still do not know if a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can pass the virus to her foetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery.

To date, the virus has not been found in samples of amniotic fluid or breastmilk.

Research results show that pregnant or recently pregnant women with COVID-19 were more likely to give birth prematurely.  The findings also show that 1 in 4 of all babies born to women with COVID-19, were admitted to a neonatal unit but data on causes of preterm births or indications for admission to neonatal units among these babies is lacking. Stillbirth and newborn death rates however were low.

Infants born to mothers positive with COVID-19 during pregnancy are considered an at-risk group and should be monitored closely for danger signs.

Even though transmission after birth via contact with infectious secretions is a concern, it is not recommended to separate the mother from the newborn.

Close contact and early, exclusive breastfeeding help a baby to thrive.

The mother should be supported to:

* Breastfeed safely, with good respiratory hygiene
* Hold the newborn skin-to-skin, and
* Share a room with her baby (if possible, a single room with the door closed)

A woman (with confirmed COVID-19 or PUI) should use a facemask and practice hand hygiene before each feeding or other close contact with her newborn.

Consider limiting visitors except for healthy parent or caregiver.

Visitors should be instructed to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including gown, gloves, face mask, and eye protection.

### Care during pregnancy and birth

### Care during pregnancy and birth

All pregnant women, including those with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections, have the right to high quality of care before, during and after childbirth.

This includes antenatal, newborn, postnatal, intrapartum and mental health care.

If COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed, health workers should take all appropriate precautions to reduce risks of infection to themselves and others, including hand hygiene and appropriate use of protective clothing like gloves, gown, eye protection and medical mask.

Health workers should promptly notify infection control personnel at their facility of the anticipated arrival of a pregnant patient who has confirmed COVID-19 or is a person under investigation (PUI).

**If possible, patients with known or suspected COVID-19 should be cared for in a single-person room with the door closed.**

## Mode of delivery

Women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 DO NOT need to give birth by caesarean section.

WHO advices that caesarean sections should only be performed when medically justified.

As usual, the mode of birth should be individualized and based on a woman’s preferences alongside obstetric indications.

### Breastfeeding and COVID-19

### Breastfeeding and COVID-19

Women with COVID-19 can breastfeed if they wish to do so.

![](/richtext/AC_breastfeeding_correct_attachment)

When breastfeeding, they should:

* Practice respiratory hygiene during feeding, wearing a mask where available.
* Wash hands before and after touching the baby.
* Routinely clean and disinfect surfaces they have touched.

If a woman with COVID-19 and her baby are temporarily separated, consider the following:

* Encourage breast milk expression to establish and maintain milk supply.
* Use hand hygiene prior to milk expression.
* Healthy caregiver should feed the baby with the expressed breast milk.

### COVID-19: Vaccination Guidelines

### General information

Where available, health care providers should follow local country guidance on use of the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and breastfeeding as guidance may differ in each setting.

### Pregnancy

Pregnant women can be vaccinated against COVID-19.

COVID-19 vaccines offer strong protection against severe illness from COVID-19. If not already vaccinated, pregnant women should have access to WHO EUL-approved vaccines, because COVID-19 during pregnancy puts them at higher risk of becoming severely ill and of giving birth to preterm babies.

Increasing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy suggests that the benefits of vaccination during pregnancy outweigh potential risks whenever there is ongoing or anticipated community transmission of the virus.

COVID-19 vaccination before or during pregnancy is especially important for pregnant women at highest risk from COVID-19, such as frontline health workers, people living in areas of high transmission, and those with health conditions like hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes that add to their risk of severe disease.

### Supporting women to make informed decisions about the benefits of receiving the vaccine in pregnancy.

Discussion with health care providers can help pregnant women inform their decision about receiving the vaccine and assess personal risks and benefits.

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_Initial_assessment)

Pregnant women who decline vaccination should be supported in their decision.

Regardless of the woman’s decision to receive or not receive the vaccine, discussions should remind pregnant or breastfeeding women and their families about the importance of other prevention measures

### Breastfeeding

Women who are breastfeeding can take the vaccine when it becomes available to them.

None of the currently approved vaccines use the live virus, so there is no risk of passing the virus to the baby through the breastmilk.

There is some evidence that, after vaccination, antibodies are found in the breastmilk, which may help protect the baby against COVID-19.
