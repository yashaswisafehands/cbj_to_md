# Module: Hypertension

## Action Cards

### Definitions

### Definition of the four types of hypertension

### 1. Hypertension

Hypertension is persistent high blood pressure (At or above 140 mmHg systolic or/and at or above 90 mmHg diastolic)

---

---

---

### 2. Pre-eclampsia

Preeclampsia is new onset hypertension (see above) after 20 gestational weeks with significant protein (2+) in the urine.

---

### 3. Severe Pre-eclampsia

Severe preeclampsia is any hypertension with ONE or more OF the following:

1. Severely elevated blood pressure (160 mmHg or higher systolic OR 110 mmHg or higher diastolic), OR
2. Persistent severe headache behind the eyes, OR
3. Visual disturbances like flashing lights or blurry vision, OR
4. Persistent upper abdominal pain from the liver, OR
5. Respiratory distress caused by pulmonary oedema, OR
6. Decreased urine production (less than 400 ml per day).

---

---

### 4. Eclampsia

Eclampsia is when a woman develops generalised seizures in relation to pregnancy.

Usually these women suffer from preeclampsia though 10-20% of women with eclampsia have a normal blood pressure.

Consider as differential diagnosis cerebral malaria or meningitis.

---

### Management Hypertension

### Blood Pressure 140-159/90-109

![](/icon/actioncard/hypertension_management_hypertension1_ac)

### BP above 160/110

### Hypertension Management Eclampsia

### Management of Eclampsia

CALL FOR HELP

1. Check Airway and Breathing.
2. Fits are self-limiting. While convulsing, prevent the woman from trauma by tilting her to one side.
3. Insert IV lines.

![](/icon/actioncard/hypertension_management_eclampsia1_ac)

---

### Emergency Referral - Hypertension

### Emergency referral for hypertension

Emergency!

Never refer a patient while convulsing and with uncontrolled hypertension.

After emergency management and when in a stable condition, discuss decision of referral with woman and relatives.

Quickly organize transport and possible financial aid.

Inform the referral center.

Accompany the woman.

It is crucial that the woman is accompanied by a health worker who is trained in delivery care and able to manage an emergency situation, if it occurs or resurrects during transport.

Consider to bring a relative who can donate blood.

---

### Bring

Referral note.

## Essential emergency drugs:

---

### During Transport

![](/key learning points/Manual removal of placenta/ambulance)

Observe vital signs and level of consciousness.

If the woman’s condition permits:

Keep record of all IV fluids, medications given, time of administration and the woman´s condition.

---

### If in labour during transport:

If pushing and superficial breathing is not enough to repress this urge, stop the transport and deliver the woman.

---

## Procedures

### Urinary catheter

### Urinary catheter - usage

Catheterize only when necessary.   
  
Emptying the bladder with a urinary catheter is indicated:

1. If a woman in labour fails to urinate spontaneously and the progress of labour is dissatisfactory, **OR**
2. Prior to applying vacuum extrator **OR**
3. In cases of postpartum haemorrhage, **AND**
4. In any servere condition such as maternal sepsis or severe preeclampsia/eclampsia to monitor the urine output. In this case, the catheter should stay in place until the condition improves (indwelling urinary catheter).

# Indwelling Urinary Catheter

![](/richtext/urine_catheter)

## Practical information

An indwelling urinary catheter is a catheter that is inserted into the bladder via the urethra and left in the bladder to drain urine.

All women in a critical condition (sepsis, severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, bleeding, shock) must have an indwelling urinary catheter, and the hourly urine output should be at least 30 ml.

If less, the underlying cause should be treated and fluid replacement considered, although not more than 80 ml per hour (oral and IV) should be given for women with preeclampsia as the risk of fluid overload and pulmonary oedema increases.

## Procedure

1. Perform handwashing prior to the procedure and apply gloves.
2. The woman should be lying on her back with knees flexed and thighs relaxed.
3. Place a blanket/sheet to cover the woman as much as possible.
4. If available, cover the woman in sterile drape.
5. Apply sterile gloves.
6. Separate the labia with one hand and expose urethral opening.
7. The area around the urethra should be cleaned twice with gauze swabs and normal saline water.
8. Lubricate catheter.
9. Insert the catheter into the urethral opening.
10. Inflate the balloon slowly by using sterile water to reach the volume recommended on the catheter.
11. **ALWAYS** ensure urine is flowing before inflating the balloon.
12. Pull back the catheter slightly until resistance is felt and attach it to the drainage system with the urine bag.
13. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.

## Removal

1. Explain the procedure to the woman.
2. Ensure privacy and have the woman placed on her back or on a toilet.
3. Perform hand hygiene and put on gloves.
4. Deflate the balloon completely or cut the catheter at the ballon inflation point to ensure the ballon is deflated.
5. Gently pull back the catheter.
6. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
7. Observe urine output after removal of catheter.
8. The woman should urinate spontanously 4-6 hours after the removal.

# Intermittent Urinary Catheter

## Practical Information

Intemittent urinary catheter is inserted at regular intervals or when urination is required but the women is not able to empty the bladder herself.

## Procedure

1. Perform handwashing prior to the procedure.
2. The woman should be lying on her back with knees flexed and thighs relaxed.
3. Place a blanket/sheet to cover the woman as much as possible.
4. If available, cover the woman in sterile drape.
5. Apply sterile gloves.
6. Separate labia with one hand and expose urethral opening.
7. The area around the urethra should be cleaned twice with gauze swabs and normal saline water.
8. Lubricate catheter.
9. Insert catheter into the urethral opening.
10. Empty the womans bladder and remove the catheter.
11. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
12. Note down the urine volume.

### Intravenous access equipment

### Intravenous access - usage

Intravenous access is used to administer fluids and drugs.

Equipment for intravenous access should be located in the delivery room.

It should be available at all health facilities for adults as well as newborn.

It includes:

**Antiseptic solution** to clean the surrounding skin, syringes, intravenous cannulas, a stasis hose/band, tapes, gauze and cannulas.

### Intravenous Access - Practical information

### Adults:

The grey (gauge 16) and green (gauge 18) cannulas have a large diameter.

Using them makes the fluid enter the veines more rapidly.

---

### Newborns:

For insertion of an intravenous cannula in the neonate select a suitable vein to place the cannula or a gauge 21 or 23 butterfly needle.

![](/richtext/pp_iv_baby_english_text)

---

### Peripheral vein:

* Identify an accessible peripheral vein, see illustration.

* An assistant should keep the position of the limb steady and should act as a tourniquet by obstructing the venous return with his or her fingers lightly closed around the limb. Alternatively use a stasis hose/band.

* Clean the surrounding skin with an **antiseptic solution** (such as **spirit**, **iodine**, **isopropyl alcohol** or **70 % alcohol solution**), then introduce the cannula into the vein and insert most of its length. Fix the catheter securely with tape. Apply a splint with the limb in an appropriate position (e.g. elbow extended, wrist slightly flexed).

![](/richtext/pp_iv_baby)

---

### Scalp vein:

These are often used in children under 2 years of age.

* Find a suitable scalp vein (usually in the midline of the forehead, the temporal area or above or behind the ear).

* Shave the area if necessary, and clean the skin with an **antiseptic solution**. The assistant should occlude the vein proximal to the site of puncture. Fill a syringe and leave the end of the tubing open. Introduce the butterfly needle as described above. Blood flowing back slowly through the tubing indicates that the needle is in the vein.

* Care should be taken not to cannulate an artery, which is recognised by palpation. If there is a pulsatile spurting of blood, withdraw the needle and apply pressure until the bleeding stops; then look for the vein.

---

### Follow-up visits

### Follow-up visits:

Women with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia with no severe features should be seen twice a week until 37 weeks when they should be delivered.

They should be warned and advised to seek care if experiencing danger signs; head-ache, visual disturbances, dizziness, nausea, and upper abdominal pain.

## At each visit you should check:

* Blood pressure
* Weight of the mother
* Signs of generalized edema
* Monitor the fetal condition (fetal weight estimate, fundal height, fetal movement and fetal heart rate)
* Respiratory rate (if above 22 per minute, admit)
* Reflexes
* Assess for danger signs (see above)

Women with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia without severe features, do not need to be admitted if they can be seen twice a week and can access care immediately, should they develop severe features.

## Drugs

### Calcium Gluconate

# Indications and Usage

In case of intoxication with Magnesium Sulphate where withdrawing the magnesium supplementation is not sufficient:

give the antidote Calcium Gluconate IV.

The actions of magnesium in neuromuscular and cardiac function are antagonized by calcium.

# Dosage and Administration

At Magnesium Sulphate intoxication with loss of tendon reflexes and a respiratory rate < 12/min. give Calcium Gluconate 1 g (10 mL of 10% solution) IV slowly over three minutes, until respiration begins to counteract the effect of Magnesium Sulphate.

At heart arrest give Calcium Gluconate 1 g (10 ml. of 10% solution) IV push.

This dose may be repeated once if necessary in severe cases of hypermagnesaemia (where discontinuation of exogenous magnesium is inadequate) to temporarily reverse many of the toxic effects of magnesium in the central nervous system.

# Contraindications

Calcium salts are contraindicated in patients with ventricular fibrillation or hypercalcaemia.

Intravenous administration of calcium is contraindicated when serum calcium levels are above normal.

# Adverse Reactions

Nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, constipation, dry mouth, increased thirst, increased urination, tingling sensations, hot flashes, and a chalky taste following intravenous administration.

---

### Dexamethasone

# Indications and Usage

For lung maturation and prevention of respiratory distress and vertebral haemorrhage of the newborn at threatening preterm labour between 24 and 34 weeks gestation.

# Dosage and Administration

12 mg IM, 2 doses, 24 hours apart.

# Contraindications

Active untreated infections.

# Adverse Reactions

Vision changes, swelling, rapid weight gain, sleep problems (insomnia), mood changes, acne, dry skin, thinning skin, bruising or discoloration, slow wound healing, increased sweating, headache, dizziness, spinning sensation, nausea, stomach pain, bloating, muscle weakness, or changes in the shape or location of body fat (especially in your arms, legs, face, neck, breasts, and waist).

Rare instances of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy such as dexamethasone.

---

### Hydralazine

# Indications and Usage

Antihypertensive drug used for example at preeclampsia and pregnancy induced hypertension.

During pregnancy systolic blood pressure above 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure above 110 mmHg on repeated readings should be treated and delivery planned within 24 hours.

**CAUTION:** Diastolic blood pressure should not be lowered below 80 mmHg to avoid effect on foetal circulation.

# Dosage and Administration

5 mg IV slowly (3-4 minutes) every 20 minutes until blood pressure is reduced to below 160 mmHg systolic and 110 mmHg diastolic.

Give maximum 20 mg/24 hours.

The aim is to reduce diastolic BP to around 90 mmHg.

It is important that before delivery the diastolic blood pressure should not be lowered below 80 mmHg, otherwise the blood supply to the foetus might be compromised.

# Contraindications

Tachycardia, lupus erythematosus disseminatus, and rheumatoid arthritis.

# Adverse Reactions

Common adverse reactions are headache, flushing, tachycardia, allergic reactions and abdominal pain.

Uncommon adverse reactions are nose congestion, feeling disorders, increased tear flow, and tremor.

---

### Labetalol

# Indications and Usage

An adrenergic a- and b- receptor antagonist used to treat hypertension in pregnancy.

A persistent blood pressure at or above 150 mmHg systolic or at or above 100 mmHg diastolic should be treated.

CAUTION:

Diastolic blood pressure should not be lowered below 80 mmHg to avoid affecting foetal circulation.

# Dosage and Administration

**Non-severe hypertension**

Systolic BP: Above 149 mmHg or diastolic BP above 99 mmHg.

Administer 200 mg orally every 6 to 12 hours.

The maximum dose is 1.2 g (6 tablets) per 24 hours.

**Severe hypertension**

Systolic BP: Above 159 mmHg or diastolic BP above 109 mmHg.

Administer 200 mg orally.

Repeat dose after 1 hour until the treatment goal is achieved (an important principle is to maintain blood pressures above the lower limits of normal).

The maximum dose is 1.2 mg (6 tablets) in 24 hours.

**Intravenous treatment:**

Administer 10 mg IV.

If response is inadequate after 10 minutes, administer 20 mg IV.

The dose can be doubled to 40 mg and then 80 mg with 10 minute intervals between each increased dose until blood pressure is lowered below threshold.

The maximum total dose is 300 mg; then switch to oral treatment.

Once blood pressure is reduced to non-severe levels (lower than 160/110 mmHg), ongoing treatment should be continued using oral medication.

---

**In case of severe preeclampsia:**

Delivery within 24 hours (48 hours if condition is stable and there is a need for awaiting lung matuaration of the foetus).

# Contraindications

Women with congestive heart failure, hypovolaemic shock or predisposition to bronchospasm (asthma) should not receive Labetalol.

# Adverse Reactions

Common adverse reactions are nausea, lethargy, orthostatic hypotension, dyspnoea, dizziness, headache, prickling sensation in the scalp, skin rash and itching, and blurry vision.

Uncommon adverse reactions are vomiting, abdominal pain, bronchial constriction, and shivering.

Rare adverse reactions are bradycardia.

---

### Lidocaine

# Indication and usage

Lidocaine is a type of local analgesia used for pain relief at deep IM injection with e.g. Magnesium Sulphate and for pain relief prior to suturing or deinfibulation.

Inject the lidocaine in the area where you are going to suture or deinfibulate

# Dosage and administration

## Infiltration

Give 0,5% or 1% with or without adrenaline subcutaneous and/or IM. Maximum dosage is 5 mg/kg.

1 bottle of 20 ml 1 % Lidocaine is equivalent to 200 mg and should be enough for suturing a perineal tear or for deinfibulation.

## Deinfibulation

Give 0,5% or 1% with or without adrenaline percutaneous. Maximum dosage is 5 mg/kg.

## IM Injection

Add 1 ml of 2% lidocaine to the medicine that should be given IM (e.g. Magnesium Sulphate).

Ensure aseptic technique in order to prevent infections and to aspirate when giving the injection in order not to inject directly into a blood vessel.

# Duration of analgesia

The analgesia is efficient 5 minutes after injection  
  
The duration of analgesia is 2 hours.

# Contraindications

Lidocaine is contraindicated in patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to local analgesics.

# Adverse reactions

Side effects with overdose of lidocaine without adrenaline are:  
• Numbness in and around the mouth  
• Swishing sound in the ears  
• Tremors with convulsions  
• Hypotension

Side effects with overdose of lidocaine with adrenaline are based on the side effects from adrenaline:  
• Palpitations  
• Headache   
• Dizziness  
• Drowsiness   
• Chest pain  
• Hypertension  
• Worst case cardiac arrest

At symptoms of overdose, stop treatment, call for help, monitor closely and treat symptoms.

### Magnesium Sulphate

# Indications and Usage

To treat eclamptic fits and to prevent eclamptic fits (should be given to all women with severe pre-eclampsia during delivery).

Magnesium Sulphate is the drug of choice for the treatment of women with eclampsia.

The duration of treatment should normally not exceed 24 hours beyond delivery or the last convulsion, whichever occurs last.

# Dosage and Administration

Always have the antidote Calcium Gluconate ready, when you start treatment with Magnesium Sulphate.

Give Magnesium Sulphate. You give the drug in two steps:

Step 1: You give a 20% solution of Magnesium Sulphate.

Give the woman 4 g IV slowly over 5-20 minutes (if 20% is not available see below).

Step 2: Proceed directly to give two doses of 50% solution of Magnesium Sulphate 5 g IM with 1 ml 2% Lidocaine.

One in each buttock.

Ensure aseptic technique when giving Magnesium Sulphate deep IM injection.

**After four hours:**

Maintenance dose continued (IM):

Give one dose of 5 g of 50% Magnesium Sulphate solution with 1 ml of 2% Lidocaine in the same syringe by deep IM injection into alternate buttocks.

Repeat every four hours.

Change side with each injection.

Continue treatment for 24 hours after birth or the last convulsion, whichever occurs last.

If fits occur after Magnesium Sulphate has been started give a reduced loading dose of 2 g IV over 10 minutes.

**How to mix a 20% solution**

To prepare a 20% Magnesium Sulphate solution from a 50% concentrated solution. Do the following:

Take 8 ml of 50% solution: 4 ml in each of 10 ml syringes.

Dilute each with 6 ml of sterile water, normal saline from IV flask) to fill the syringes up to 10 ml.

Each 10 ml syringe will now have 20% solution of Magnesium Sulfate, a total of 20 ml.

Inject both syringes (20 ml) IV into the cannula port of a normal saline drip at a rate of about 2-3 mls/min).

# Contraindications

Renal failure and atrioventricular block.

Uliguria is not a contraindication for Magnesium Sulphate treatment, but pay attention particularly to women with reduced urine output:

If signs of respiratory depression (respiratory rate below 15 per minute) the maintenance dose should also be postponed.

# Adverse Reactions

Magnesium Sulphate can be toxic, the first signs of overdose is the absence of tendon reflexes, so before giving maintenance dose each 4 hours, tendon reflexes must be checked, if absent, the injection should not be given and tendon reflexes checked after another 4 hours.

---

At a respiratory rate less than 12 per minute, the antidote Calcium Gluconate 1 g should be given IV over 3 minutes.

At cardiac arrest the antidote must be given push.

---

Magnesium Sulphate should not be combined with Diazepam or any other anticonvulsant as the risk of severe adverse reactions is considerably increased.

The so-called “lytic cocktail” combining different drugs is life-threatening and should never be given.

A common and not serious adverse reaction is flushing.

---

### Methyldopa

# Indications and Usage

Hypertension, persistant blood pressure of 150 mmHg systolic or above or diastolic of 100 mmHg or above.

# Dosage and Administration

**Non-severe hypertension**

Systolic BP above 149 mmHg or diastolic BP above 99 mmHg:

Administer 250 mg orally every 6-8 hours.

Can be gradually increased up to 500 mg every 6 hours.

Maximum dose: 2 g (8 tablets) per 24 hours.

For fast control of the blood pressure this is not the drug to choose as it works rather slow.

Give Methyldopa and at the same time give a quick-acting drug like Labetalol or Hydralazine.

In case of severe preeclampsia:   
  
Delivery within 24 hours (48 hours if condition is stable and there is a need for awaiting lung matuaration of a foetus (GA: 24-34)).

# Contraindications

Active hepatic disease, such as acute hepatitis and active cirrhosis.

# Adverse Reactions

Common adverse reactions are; swelling of feet or lower legs, drowsiness, dryness of mouth, and headache.

Uncommon adverse reactions are; mental depression or anxiety, nightmares or unusually vivid dreams, numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness in hands or feet, slow heartbeat, and stuffy nose.

Rare adverse reactions are; dark or amber urine, diarrhoea or stomach cramps (severe or continuous), fever, chills, troubled breathing, and fast heartbeat, general feeling of discomfort or illness or weakness, joint pain, pale stools, skin rash or itching, yellow eyes or skin.

### Nifedipine

# Indications and Usage

Calcium antagonist used to treat hypertension in pregnancy.

**CAUTION:** Diastolic blood pressure should not be lowered below 80 mmHg. to foetal circulation.

It is not uncommon that Nifedipine actually lowers the blood pressure below this point, and therefore should not be given as the first drug of choice.

(Alternatives could be Labetalol or Methyldopa for oral treatment and Hydralazine for IV treatment).

In case of severe preeclampsia delivery should be planned within 24 hours (48 hours if the woman's condition leaves time for lung maturation of a foetus between GA 24 and 34).

Tocolysis:

Nifedipine can stop contractions at threatening preterm birth before 34 weeks of gestation to give time for lung maturation therapy (Dexamethasone or Betamethasone).

Tocolysis must not be given if chorioamnionitis is suspected.

# Dosage and Administration

See **CAUTION** under "indications and usage".

In some settings, Nifedipine is available in more than one formulation (e.g. immediate-release, intermediate-release and sustained-release).

Immediate-release Nifedipine is included here, unless we indicate otherwise.

To avoid medication errors, it is important to specify and confirm the Nifedipine formulation before administering it.

**Non-severe hypertension:**

Systolic BP above 149 mmHg or diastolic BP above 99 mmHg:

Administer 10–20 mg orally every 12 hours.

The maximum dose is 120 mg per 24 hours.

**Severe hypertension:**

Systolic BP above 159 mmHg or diastolic BP above 109 mmHg:

Oral treatment:

Administer 5–10 mg orally.

Repeat dose after 30 minutes if response is inadequate until optimal blood pressure is reached.

The maximum total dose is 30 mg in the acute treatment setting - other treatment options should be considered if blood pressure is not lowered within the acute treatment phase of 90 minutes with 30 mg immediate-release.

The antihypertensive effect is fastest if given sublingually but the effect can be to strong and cause hypotension and compromised foetal circulation.

---

**Tocolysis:**

10 mg orally every 15 minutes until contractions stop for a maximum of 4 doses, then 20 mg oral every 6 hours.

Treatment should not exceed 24 hours.

Tocolysis is contraindicated if chorioamnionitis or abrupted placenta is suspected.

Give a tocolytic drug (e.g. nifedipine) to provide a window for administration of antenatal corticosteroids and/or in-utero fetal transfer to an appropriate neonatal health care setting: Give a loading dose of 20 mg nifedipine immediate-release sublingually.

If required, give an additional 10 mg every 15 minutes up to a maximum of 40 mg in the first hour.

Follow up with 20 mg sustained-release tablet (pay attention to the formulation) orally daily for up to 48 hours or until transfer is completed, whichever comes first.

Monitor maternal and foetal condition (pulse, blood pressure, signs of respiratory distress, uterine contractions, loss of amniotic fluid or blood, foetal heart rate, fluid balance).

Note: Do not give tocolytic drugs for more than 48 hours.

* Do not give a combination of tocolytic agents as there is no additional benefit.
* Tocolytics should not be used in the following conditions: - preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) - chorioamnionitis - placental abruption - cardiac disease.

# Contraindications

Treatment with Rifampicin.

Suspected foetal distress, suspected abruption of placenta, suspected chorioamnionitis.

Tocolytics should not be used in the following conditions: - preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) - chorioamnionitis - placental abruption - cardiac disease.

**CAUTION:** see above, should not be the first drug of choice to treat hypertension.

# Adverse Reactions

Common adverse reactions are constipation, vasodilatation, oedema, headache, flushing, dizzyness, tiredness, and itching.

Uncommon adverse reactions are nausea, dryness of the mouth, heart palpitations, respiratory distress, nose bleeding, joint pain, anxiety, sleeping disturbances, frequent urge for and painful urination, visual disturbances and allergic reactions.

Rare adverse reactions are urticaria and other severe allergic reactions.
