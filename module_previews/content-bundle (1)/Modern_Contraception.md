# Module: Modern Contraception

## Action Cards

### Long-acting methods

# Contraceptive implant

Implants are small, flexible, plastic rods, that are placed just under the skin of the upper arm that release an artificial hormone, progestin, that is like natural progesterone. They work by preventing ovulation and thickening the cervical mucus, blocking sperm from reaching an egg  
  
They provide very effective (99.9%) contraception for 3-5 years, depending on the type of implant. For every 100 women using implants, there will only be less than 1 that gets pregnant in one year (1 per 1,000 women)  
  
Protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs): **None**  
  
Return of fertility after removal: **No delay**

![](/icon/actioncard/contraceptive_implant)

## Insertion

An implant is ideally inserted in the first five days of the menstrual cycle but can be inserted any time if you are reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant  
  
A trained provider performs a minor surgical procedure to place one or 2 rods under the skin on the inside of a woman’s upper arm

## Removal

A trained provider performs a minor surgical procedure to remove the implant(s)

![](/icon/actioncard/implant_removal)

## Women with HIV

Women who are living with HIV or are on antiretroviral therapy (ART) can safely use implants. However, medications for HIV such as efavirenz, nevirapine and ritonavir may reduce the effectiveness of this implant. Therefore, women with the implant taking ART should also use condoms for better protection against pregnancy

## Some women like implants as they:

* Do not require the user to do anything once inserted
* Protect against pregnancy effectively
* Are long-lasting and reversible
* Do not interfere with sex

## Why some women may not like implants

* Side effects
* They require small procedures for insertion and removal
* No STI protection

## Side effects (from common to least common)

* Changes in bleeding patterns, headaches, abdominal pain, acne, weight changes, breast tenderness, dizziness, mood changes and nausea
* Some may experience ovarian cysts (usually resolve without treatment)

## Known health benefits

* Helps to protect against risks of pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancy, and symptomatic pelvic inflammatory disease
* May protect against iron-deficiency anaemia
* Reduces ectopic pregnancy risk

## Known health risks

None

## Complications

* Infection at insertion site (uncommon)
* Difficult removal (common)
* Expulsion of implant (rare)
* Implant migration due to improper insertion, for example, to a blood vessel (extremely rare)

# Copper intrauterine device (IUD)

The copper-IUD is a small, flexible plastic frame with copper sleeves or wire around it, that work by damaging the sperm and egg before they can meet.  
  
IUDs are one of the most effective (99.4%) and long-lasting methods and can be effective from 5 – 10 years depending on the type. For every 100 women that use an IUD, less than 1 will become pregnant within the first year (6 out of 1,000 women).   
  
Almost all types of IUDs have one or two strings, or threads, tied to them. The strings hang through the cervix into the vagina.   
  
Protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs): **None**   
  
Return of fertility after removal: **No delay**

![](/icon/actioncard/copper_intrauterine_device_(IUD))

## Insertion

A specifically trained health care provider inserts it into a woman’s uterus through her cervix.  
  
Teach the woman how to check that her IUD is still in place, how to identify symptoms of pelvic infection, and that delayed menstrual periods suggest possible pregnancy.

## Follow-up

A follow-up appointment is recommended after her first menstrual bleeding or 3-6 weeks after insertion.

## Some women like copper-IUDs as they

* Prevent pregnancy effectively
* Are long-lasting
* Are private (usually no one else can tell a woman is using contraception, sometimes a partner may feel the strings during sex)
* Have no further costs for supplies after the IUD is inserted
* Do not require the user to do anything once inserted

## Why some women may not like copper-IUDs

* Side effects
* No STI protection
* Insertion and removal can be uncomfortable or painful

## Side effects

Some users reported changes in bleeding patterns, especially within the first 3-6 months (typically more irregular, longer and heavier bleeding, with more painful cramps)

## Known heath benefits

* Helps prevent pregnancy
* May help protect against endometrial and cervical cancers
* Reduces the risk of ectopic pregnancy

## Known health risks

* Heavier bleeding may contribute to anaemia if a woman already has low iron blood stores (uncommon)
* Risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) if woman has chlamydia or gonorrhoea at the time of IUD insertion (rare)

## Complications

* Puncturing (perforation) of the wall of the uterus by the IUD or an instrument used for insertion, which usually heals without treatment (rare).
* Miscarriage, preterm birth, or infection in the rare case that the woman becomes pregnant with the IUD in place (rare).

# Hormonal IUD or Intrauterine System (IUS)

The hormonal IUD (IUS) is a T-shaped device that steadily releases a small amount of a synthetic hormone, progestin, each day. Progestins, such as levonorgestrel used in IUS, mimic the natural hormone progesterone. An IUS works by preventing sperm from reaching and fertilizing the egg cell and is one of the most effective and long-lasting methods.   
  
The IUS is one of the most effective (99.8%) and long-lasting methods of contraception and can be effective from 3-5 years. For every 100 women that use an IUS, there will be less than 1 pregnancy in the first year (2 out of 1,000 women).   
  
Protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs): **None**   
  
Return of fertility after removal: **No delay**

![](/icon/actioncard/copper_intrauterine_device_(IUD))

# Insertion

A specifically trained health care provider inserts it into a woman’s uterus through her cervix  
  
An IUS can be fitted 4 weeks after giving birth, and in some cases within 48 hours after birth  
  
Teach the woman how to check that her IUS is still in place, how to identify symptoms of pelvic infection, and that delayed menstrual periods suggest possible pregnancy

## Follow-up

A follow-up contact is recommended either after her first menstrual bleeding or 3-6 weeks after insertion

## Removal

The IUS can be removed at any time by a trained provider. If the woman does not wish to get pregnant, recommend not to have sex for 7 days prior to removal.

## Some women like IUS as they

* Are long-lasting
* May make bleeding lighter, shorter or temporarily stop
* Prevent pregnancy effectively
* No further costs or actions needed after insertion
* Are private (usually no one else can tell a woman is using contraception, sometimes a partner may feel the strings during sex)

## Why some women may not like IUS

* Side effects
* No STI protection
* Insertion and removal can be uncomfortable or painful

## Side effects

Changes in bleeding pattern (periods may become lighter, shorter or temporarily stop) (most common), acne, headaches, breast tenderness or pain, nausea, weight gain, dizziness and mood changes.

Some may experience ovarian cysts (usually resolve without treatment)

## Known health benefits

* Helps prevent pregnancy and protect against iron-deficiency anaemia
* May help protect against endometrial and cervical cancer
* Reduces menstrual cramps, heavy menstrual periods, symptoms of endometriosis, and risk of ectopic pregnancy.

## Known health risks

Risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) if woman has chlamydia or gonorrhoea at the time of IUD insertion (rare).

## Complications

* Rejection (expulsion) by the womb, leading to displacement. (Rare)
* Damage to the womb by the IUS or insertion device that usually heals without treatment. (Rare)
* If the IUS fails, there is an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm birth and infection (very rare).

### Short-acting methods

# Female condom

Female comdoms are soft, thin latex or synthetic latex single-use coverings that fit loosely inside a woman's vagina. They work by forming a barrier that keeps sperm out of the vagina, preventing pregnancy.

With typical use, female condoms are 79% effective. This means that for every 100 women using female condoms, 21 will become pregnant in 1 year. Very few pregnancies or infections occur due to incorrect use, slips, or breaks. If this happens, you may need to use emergency contraception.

![](/icon/actioncard/female_condom)

Protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs):

* Reduce the risk of STIs, including HIV when used correctly with every act of sex.

Return of fertility after removal: **No delay**

## Use

A female condom needs to be placed inside the vagina before any contact with the penis  
  
Insertion and removal of female condoms from the vagina can be difficult but becomes easier with experience. They can get pushed inside the vagina during sex but are easy for women to remove themselves  
  
Check the packet to find out which lubricants are suitable

## Why some women like female condoms

* Help to prevent both pregnancy and the spread of STIs
* Only need to use when having sex
* No serious side effects
* Women can initiate use
* Feels more natural and less constricting than male condoms
* Do not dull the sensation of sex like male condoms
* Outer ring can provide added sexual stimulation for some women
* Contact with health provider not needed
* Can be inserted ahead of time to not disrupt sex

## Why some women may not like female condoms

* Condoms may interrupt sex, split or slip off during sex
* Less accessible and affordable than male condoms

## Side effects

None

## Known health benefits

Helps prevent pregnancy and protect against STIs, including HIV

## Known health risks

None

# Male condom

Male condoms are very thin, single-use coverings that are worn on the penis while erect. Condoms are made from latex, polyisoprene, polyurethane, lambskin, or nitrile. They designed to stop semen from coming into contact with a sexual partner, effectively preventing pregnancy and the transmission of infections.

With typical use, male condoms are 87% effective. This means that for every 100 women using male condoms, 13 will become pregnant in 1 year. Very few pregnancies or infections occur due to incorrect use, slips, or breaks. If this happens, you may need to use emergency contraception.

![](/icon/actioncard/male_condom)

Protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs):

* Make sure the penis does not touch the female genital area before a condom has been applied
* Significantly protects agains STIs spread by discharge, such as HIV, gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Also protects against STIs spread by skin-to-skin contact, such as herpes and human papillomavirus
* When used consistently and correctly, condom use prevents 80% to 95% of HIV transmission that would have occured without condoms

Return of fertility after removal: No delay

## Use

Oil-based products such as moisturiser, lotion and Vaseline can damage latex and polyisoprene condoms

## Some women like male condoms as they

* Have no hormonal size effects
* Can be used as a regular, temporary or backup method
* Contact with health care provider not needed
* Generally easy to obtain
* Can increased the duration of sex
* Reliable method of pregnancy and STIs when used correctly and consistently

## Why some women may not like male condoms

* Some find that condoms interrupt sex
* Occasionally condoms may split or slip off during sex

## Side effects

None

## Known health benefits

* Helps prevent pregnancy and protect against STIs, including HIV
* May help protect against conditions caused by STIs: recurring pelvic inflammatory disease and chronic pelvic pain, cervical cancer, infertility (male and female)

## Known health risks

Severe allergic reaction (among people with latex allergy). (Extremely rare)

# Combined oral contraceptives

Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) contain artificial versions of the naturally produced hormones, oestrogen and progesterone. They work primarily by preventing the release of eggs from the ovaries.   
  
COCs are 93% effective with typical use. This means that for every 100 women that use COCs, 7 will become pregnant within one year. Taking pills correctly and consistently will reduce the risk of pregnancy. Skipping pills increases this risk and can make some side effects worse.   
  
Protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs): **None**   
  
Return of fertility after COCs are stopped: **No delay**

![](/icon/actioncard/combined_oral_contraceptives)

## Use

The woman should take **one pill at the same time every day** and take any missed pill as soon as possible. Changes in the bleeding patterns are common but not harmful. Some report lighter bleeding and fewer days of bleeding, irregular/infrequent bleeding, or no menstrual periods.   
  
They can be given to a woman at any time to start now or later, if it is reasonably certain she is not pregnant.

## Follow-up

Encourage the woman to come back for more pills before she uses up her supply of pills  
  
An annual visit is recommended. Some women can benefit from contact after 3 months of COC use to answer any questions, help with any problems, and check on correct use

## Why some women like COCs

* Controlled by women
* Does not interrupt sex
* Can be stopped at any time without a provider’s help
* Often makes bleeding lighter, more regular and less painful
* Easy to use

## Why some women may not like COCs

* Side effects
* No STI protection
* Requires daily action

## Side effects

Changes in bleeding pattern (often lighter, irregular, infrequent or absence of bleeding), headaches, dizziness, nausea, breast tenderness, weight changes, mood changes, and acne.

Some experience slight increase in blood pressure while taking COCs

## Known health benefits

* Helps prevent pregnancy and protect against endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, and pelvic inflammatory disease symptoms
* May help protect against ovarian cysts and iron deficiency anaemia.
* Reduces menstrual cramps, menstrual bleeding problems, ovulation pain, excess hair on face or body, polycystic ovarian syndrome symptoms and endometriosis symptoms.

## Known health risks

* Blood clot in deep veins of legs or lungs (very rare)
* Stroke (extremely rare)
* Heart attack (extremely rare)

# Progestin-only pills

Progestin-Only Pills (POPs), also called “minipills”, contain low doses of a synthetic hormone, progestin, that mimics natural progesterone. They work by thickening the cervical mucus which blocks sperms from meeting the egg. They also prevent ovulation.  
  
POPs are 93% effective with typical use. This means that for every 100 women that use POPs, 7 will become pregnant within one year. Taking pills correctly and consistently will reduce the risk of pregnancy. Skipping pills increases this risk and can make some side effects worse.   
  
Protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs): **None**   
  
Return of fertility after POPs are stopped: **No delay**

![](/icon/actioncard/Progestin_only_pills)

## Use

The woman should take **one pill every day** and take any missed pill as soon as possible.

## Follow-up

Encourage the woman to come back for more pills before she uses up her supply of pills.  
  
Contacting women after the first 3 months of POP use is recommended. This offers an opportunity to answer any questions, help with any problems, and check on correct use.

## Why some women like POPs

* Can be used while breastfeeding
* Can be stopped at any time without a provider’s help
* Do not interfere with sex
* Are controlled by the woman

## Why some women do not like POPs

* Side effects
* No STI protection
* Daily action required

## Side effects

Changes in bleeding patterns, headaches, dizziness, mood changes, breast tenderness, abdominal pain and nausea.   
  
Some non-breastfeeding women may experience ovarian cysts (usually resolve without treatment).

## Known health benefits

Helps prevent pregnancy

## Known health risks

None

# Emergency contraception

Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs), or “morning after” pills, are tablets that prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex, rape or sexual assault, or mistakes using contraception. ECP types include UPA, mifepristone, LNG and combined hormonal tablets. They work by preventing or delaying ovulation, which prevents sperm from meeting and fertilizing the egg. They will not work if a woman is already pregnant.   
  
The copper-IUD can also be used as emergency contraception.   
  
The effectiveness of emergency contraception depends on the type used, the timing of administration in relation to the menstrual cycle and intercourse, and timing of sexual intercourse in relation to ovulation. Out of 100 women that have unprotected sex once in 2nd and 3rd weeks of their menstrual cycle, there will be 8 pregnancies. If they had taken an EC, there would likely be <1 to 2 pregnancies, depending on the type.   
  
Protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs): **None**   
  
Return of fertility taking EC: **24 hours** (no delay)

![](/icon/actioncard/emergency_contraceptives)

## Use

They can be used by women of any age, including adolescents.   
  
The sooner ECPs are taken after unprotected sex, the more effective they are. They should therefore be taken as soon as possible **within 5 days after unprotected sex**. Pregnancy will also be prevented for an unprotected sex **within 24 hours after taking ECs**.   
  
Copper IUDs for emergency contraception should be inserted **within 5 days after the first episode of unprotected sex** since the start of their last natural menstrual period, or **up to 5 days after the earliest likely date of ovulation** – **whichever is later**.

## Side effects

Short term changes in bleeding patterns, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, headaches, breast tenderness, dizziness and vomiting in the first few days after taking ECs.

## Known health benefits

Helps prevent pregnancy

## Known health risks

None

# Monthly injectables

Monthly injectables, or combined injectable contraceptives (CICs), contain 2 synthetic hormones, a progestin and an oestrogen, that mimic the natural hormones, progesterone and oestrogen. They work by preventing the ovulation.  
  
CICs are 97% effective with typical use. This means that for every 100 women taking CICs, 3 will be pregnant in a year. Having CICs on time improves effectiveness.  
  
Protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs): **None**   
  
Return of fertility after injections are stopped: **An average of 5 months**

![](/icon/actioncard/monthly_injectables)

## Use

After administration, book next injection in 4 weeks. The woman may come up to 7 days before the scheduled day or 7 days late and still get the injection.

## Why some women like CICs

* Do not require daily action
* Are private (no one can tell that a woman is using contraception)
* Can be stopped at any time
* Are good for spacing births

## Why some women may not like CICs

* Side effects
* No STI protection

## Side effects

Changes in bleeding pattern, weight gain, headaches, dizziness and breast tenderness.

## Known health benefits

* Helps prevent pregnancy and protect against endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, and pelvic inflammatory disease symptoms
* May help protect against ovarian cysts and iron deficiency anaemia

## Known health risks

* Blood clot in deep veins of legs or lungs (very rare)
* Stroke (extremely rare)
* Heart attack (extremely rare)

# Progestin-only injectables

Progestin-only injectable (POIs) contraceptives contain a synthetic progestin that mimics the natural hormone, progesterone. The two types of POIs are DMPA and NET-EN. They work by preventing ovulation.   
  
POIs are 96% effective with typical use. This means the for every 100 women taking POIs, 4 will be pregnant in a year.   
  
Protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs): **None**   
  
Return of fertility after injections are stopped: **Between 1** (NET-EN) **– 4** (DMPA) **months,** depending on the type

![](/icon/actioncard/progestin_only_injectables)

# Use

They are given by an intramuscular injection or a subcutaneous injection. The hormone is then released slowly into the bloodstream.  
  
For DMPA the woman should have a new injection every 3 months. For NET-EN she should have a new injection every 2 months.

# Why some women like POIs

* Requires action only every 2 or 3 months
* Do not interfere with sex
* Are private: No one else can tell that a woman is using contraception
* May stop menstrual periods
* May help women to gain weight

# Why some women may not like POIs

* Side effects
* No STI protection

## Side effects

Some user experience changes in menstrual periods (most common), weight gain, headaches, dizziness, abdominal bloating and discomfort, mood changes, and less sex drive.   
  
NET-EN affects bleeding patterns less than DPMA.   
  
Other may experience loss to bone density

## Known health benefits

DMPA:

* Helps protect against risks of pregnancy, endometrial cancer and uterine fibroids.
* May help protect against pelvic inflammatory disease symptoms and iron-deficiency anaemia
* Reduces endometriosis symptoms and sickle cell crises among women with sickle cell anaemia

NET-EN:

* Helps prevent pregnancy and protect against iron-deficiency anaemia.

## Known health risks

None

# Combined vaginal ring

The combined vaginal ring (CVR) is a small soft, flexible ring that is placed inside the vagina, that slowly releases 2 synthetic hormones, progestin and oestrogen, that mimic natural progesterone and oestrogen. The hormones are absorbed by the bloodstream through the vaginal wall and work by preventing ovulation.   
  
Vaginal rings are 93% effective with typical use. This means that for every 100 women using vaginal rings, 7 will become pregnant in a year. The ring should be replaced on time for greatest effectiveness.   
  
Protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs): **None**   
  
Return of fertility after ring is removed: **No delay**

![](/icon/actioncard/combined_vaginal_ring)

## Use

The woman inserts the vaginal ring herself and leaves the ring in place for 3 weeks, then removes it for the fourth week.

## Self-insertion

1. Choose a comfortable position (e.g., standing with a leg up, squatting, or lying down)
2. She should press opposite sides of the ring together and gently push the folded ring entirely inside her vagina.
3. Deep insertion helps the ring to stay in place, and she will be less likely to feel it. The vaginal muscles naturally keep it in place.

![](/icon/actioncard/self-insertion)

## Why some women like CVRs

* Easy to use
* Does not interrupt sex
* No need to think about it every day or every act of sex
* It still works if the woman vomits or has diarrhoea
* May make periods more regular, lighter and less painful

## Why some women may not like CVRs

* Side effects
* Some may not feel comfortable with this method
* No STI protection
* Requires action every 1-3 weeks

## Side effects

Changes in bleeding pattern, headaches, white vaginal discharge, and irritation, redness or inflammation of the vagina (vaginitis)

## Known health benefits

* Helps prevent pregnancy and protect against endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, and pelvic inflammatory disease symptoms
* May help protect against ovarian cysts and iron deficiency anaemia
* Reduces menstrual cramps, menstrual bleeding problems, ovulation pain, excess hair on face or body, polycystic ovarian syndrome symptoms and endometriosis symptoms

## Known health risks

* Blood clot in deep veins of legs or lungs (very rare)
* Stroke (extremely rare)
* Heart attack (extremely rare)

# Progesterone-releasing vaginal ring

The Progesterone-Releasing Vaginal Ring (PVR) is a smooth, soft, flexible silicone ring placed in the vagina to prolong lactational amenorrhea (postponing the return of menstrual periods) and help breastfeeding women space pregnancies. The PVR works by releasing a natural progesterone that suppresses ovulation and is specifically designed for breastfeeding women in the first postpartum year.   
  
The PVR is 98% effective with correct and consistent use. Out of 100 women using a PVR, 2 will become pregnant after a year of use.   
  
Protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs): **None**   
  
Return of fertility after ring is removed: **No delay**

![](/icon/actioncard/progesterone_releasing_vaginal_ring)

## Use

The ring is placed 4-9 weeks after giving birth. Each ring is kept in place for 90 days, after which the PVR must be replaced immediately. Up to 4 rings can be used in a row without a break.

## Self-insertion

1. Choose a comfortable position (e.g., standing with one leg up, squatting, or lying down).
2. She should press opposite sides of the ring together and gently push the folded ring entirely inside her vagina.
3. Deep insertion helps the ring to stay in place, and she will be less likely to feel it. The vaginal muscles naturally keep it in place.

![](/icon/actioncard/self-insertion)

## Why some women like PVRs

* Easy to use
* Does not interrupt sex
* No need to think about it every day or every act of sex
* It still works if the woman vomits or has diarrhoea

### Contraceptive counselling

# Contraceptive counselling

## Build rapport with the woman

Greet the woman warmly and explain what will happen during the session.

Assure the woman of privacy and confidentiality.

Explain that the session is a partnership – you can provide medical information, while the woman is the expert on their own needs and preferences.

Explain that you will ask questions about their fertility intentions, preferences and past experiences in order to give them the information to help them to decide which contraceptive method is best for them.

# Contraceptive counselling

## Explore the woman's needs and preferences

Review the woman’s previous experiences of contraceptive services, including their satisfaction with current contraceptive practices and interest in starting, continuing or changing a method:

## If the woman wishes to start a new method or discuss switching methods

Continue on to step 5

## If the woman is satisfied with current method

Confirm correct use and ask about any changes in their life which may impact their method use.

Re-supply or make referral as needed.

If the woman wishes to start a new method or switch methods, ask if they have a method in mind or preference for a method.

Provide brief counselling on all available methods paying attention to the woman’s preferred methods.

Explore the woman’s lifestyle preferences, fertility intentions, risk of STIs/HIV and discuss how side effects and the selected method/s will fit into their lifestyle and their relationships (partners, family members, friends).

## Example questions:

Please tell me about yourself /and your family

* Would you like to have children/more children in the future? When?
* Are you comfortable with others, such as your partner or family, knowing about your contraception use?
* Some contraceptive methods require you to do something every day or every time you have sex, while others are inserted and don’t require you to do anything for months or years. What would be most convenient for you?
* In terms of using a contraceptive method, would you mind if there were some changes to your period?
* What do you do now to avoid STIs?

Keeping the woman's preferences and aspirations in mind, ask whether there are any methods they do not want to use or have not tolerated in the past.

Explore and provide accurate information to address any misconceptions that the woman may have about a particular method.

# Contraceptive counselling

# Provide information about methods based on the woman’s needs and preferences (including side effects)

Inform the woman of options which meet their preferences, aspirations, and lifestyle. Start with the woman’s preferred method and the most effective and easy to use methods.  
  
Explore with the woman which side effects would be acceptable to them.  
  
Advise how to manage side effects and when to return if any concerns.  
  
Advise about the possibility of switching methods.  
  
Use job aids to accurately share information about side effects, risks, and benefits of different contraceptive methods.  
  
Encourage the woman to touch and feel contraceptive method samples to aid their understanding of the method.

# Contraceptive counselling

## Assess medical eligibility and rule out pregnancy

Use the WHO medical eligibility wheel or WHO Medical Eligibility App to assess the woman’s medical eligibility  
  
Rule out pregnancy using the pregnancy exclusion checklist  
  
Eliminate methods or services that do not meet the woman’s medical eligibility or needs

![](/icon/actioncard/eligibility_wheel)

# Contraceptive counselling

## Support the woman to make a decision

Encourage the woman to make comparisons between methods or services. Assist them in weighing the benefits, disadvantages, and consequences of each option to come to a decision.  
  
Use WHO tiered counselling chart or similar job-aid to demonstrate the comparative efficacy of different contraceptive methods.  
  
Support the woman to make their own decision and ask them what their preferred method would be.  
  
Confirm that any decision the woman makes is informed, well-considered and voluntary and document consent as required. Written consent is required for implants, IUDs and permanent methods.  
  
Support the woman to make a plan for implementing their decision and provide referrals as needed.

# Tips for successful counselling

Show every woman respect and help each the woman feel at ease.

Encourage the woman to explain needs, express concerns, ask questions.

Let the woman’s wishes and needs guide the discussion.

Be alert to related needs such as protection from sexually transmitted infections including HIV, and support for condom use.

Talk with the woman in a private place, where no one else can hear.

Assure the woman that you will not tell others about your conversation or the woman’s decisions.

Listen carefully. Listening is as important as giving correct information.

Give just key information and instructions. Use words that the woman understands.

Respect and support the woman’s informed decisions.

Talk about possible side-effects, if any, and take the woman’s concerns seriously.

Check the woman’s understanding.

Invite the woman to come back any time for any reason.

## Key information for women choosing a contraceptive method should include:

Type of method – e.g. is it temporary or permanent? Hormonal or non-hormonal?     
  
Effectiveness – e.g. what are the chances of pregnancy with correct use?      
  
Side-effects, health benefits, health risks + complications.     
  
How to use or what to expect from a procedure – e.g. what practical information does the woman need to know?      
  
When to return i.e. for follow-up, resupply or if they have questions or concerns.     
  
How to prevent HIV and other STIs through dual protection.

### Permanent methods

# Tubal ligation (female sterilisation)

Tubal ligation (TL), or female sterilization, is permanent surgical contraception for women who will not want more children, in which their fallopian tubes are blocked or cut, meaning that eggs released from the ovaries cannot meet sperm.  
  
TL is 99.5% effective, and only carries a very small risk of failure. Out of 100 women that have had TL, less than one will become pregnant in 1 year (5 per 1,000 women). The effectiveness varies slightly depending on how the tubes are blocked, but pregnancy rates are low with all techniques.   
  
**Protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs):** None   
  
**Return of fertility:** Fertility generally cannot be reversed. Reversal surgery is difficult, expensive, and not available in most areas.

## Common surgical approaches

**Mini laparotomy**   
This involves making a small incision in the abdomen. The fallopian tubes are brought to the incision to be cut or blocked.   
  
**Laparoscopy**  
This involves inserting a long, thin tube containing lenses into the abdomen through a small incision. This laparoscope enables the doctor to reach and block or cut the fallopian tubes in the abdomen.

## Why some women like TL

* Has no side effects
* No need to worry about getting pregnant or about contraception again
* Nothing to do or remember after the procedure

## Why some women may not like TL

* No STI protection
* Difficult to reverse
* Associated risks

## Side effects

* None

## Known health benefits

* Helps prevent pregnancy and protect against pelvic inflammatory disease
* May help protects against ovarian cancer
* Reduces risk of ectopic pregnancy

## Known health risks

* Complications of surgery and anaesthesia (uncommon to extremely rare)

## Surgery complications

* Infection or abscess of the wound (uncommon)
* Death, due to the procedure or anaesthesia (extremely rare)
* The risk of complications with local anaeshesia is significantly lower than with general anaesthesia.
* Appropriate techniques, skills and setting minimise the risk of complications.

# Vasectomy (male sterilisation)

Vasectomy, or male sterilization, is permanent male contraception who do not want more children.

It works by closing off each vas deferens, keeping sperm out of semen and therefore preventing pregnancy.

Vasectomies are 99.8% effective. Out 100 female partners of men who have vasectomies, less than 1 will become pregnant in 1 year (2 per 1,000 women). Vasectomy is not fully effective until 3 months after the procedure.

Protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs): **None**

Return of fertility: **Fertility generally cannot be reversed.** Reversal surgery is difficult, expensive, and not available in most areas. When performed, reversal surgery often does not lead to pregnancy.

![](/icon/actioncard/vasectomy_male_sterilization))

## Procedure

Through a puncture or small incision in the scrotum, the provider locates each of the 2 tubes that carries sperm to the penis (vas deferens) and cuts or blocks them by cutting and tying them closed or by applying heat or electricity (cautery).

## Side effects

None

## Why some men like vasectomy

* Safe, permanent, and convenient
* Has fewer side effects and complications than many methods for women
* The man takes responsibility for contraception, taking the burden off the woman
* Increases enjoyment and frequency of sex

## Why some men may not like vasectomy

* No STI protection
* Difficult to reverse
* Associated risks

## Known health benefits

Helps prevent pregnancy in a partner

## Known health risk

* None

## Complications

* Severe scrotal or testicular pain that lasts for months or years (uncommon to rare)
* Infection at the incision site or inside the incision (uncommon with conventional incision technique; very rare with no-scalpel technique) (uncommon to very rare)
* Bleeding under the skin that may cause swelling or bruising (haematoma)

### Breastfeeding and contraception

# Breastfeeding and contraception

![](/richtext/postpartum_contraception)

Breastfeeding women should avoid contraceptive methods that include oestrogen, as it can reduce breastmilk production.

Women who are breastfeeding can safely use condoms, progestin-only pills or implants immediately after birth and at any time postpartum.

---

**Earliest time that a breastfeeding woman can start a contraceptive method after childbirth:**

![](/icon/actioncard/breastfeeding_and_contraception)

## Emergency contraception

Breastfeeding women can use combined oral contraceptives or levonorgestrel regimens for emergency contraception without restriction.

For the oral ulipristal acetate (Ella/ellaOne) breastfeeding is not recommended within 7 days after taking the pill, since it is excreted in breastmilk. Breastmilk should be expressed and discarded during that time.

---

## Procedures

### Implant insertion

# Implant insertion

An implant can be inserted anytime of the month if you are reasonably certain the woman is not pregnant. If inserted within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle, no back up contraception method is needed. If inserted after day 7, the woman should use back up contraception (e.g., condoms) for 7 days.  
  
Implants can be inserted immediately after childbirth, even if the client is breastfeeding. If inserted after 21 days postpartum, pregnancy must be excluded, and back-up contraception used for 7 days.

## Sterile equipment

* Sterile field
* Gloves
* Ring forceps
* Implant rod(s)
* Implant applicator or scalpel
* Metal bowl with cotton balls
* Antiseptic solution
* Syringe with needle
* 1-4ml of local anaesthetic (1% lidocaine)
* Gauze
* Bandage

## Non-sterile equipment

* Pen

## Insertion procedure

Implants can also be provided immediately after birth, miscarriage, or abortion if no infection is present.

1. Follow infection prevention techniques
2. Mark the skin on the inner side of the woman’s upper arm at 2 points about 4cm apart in the direction of insertion. Do not go too close to the elbow or armpit.
3. Place equipment on a sterile field and clean the local area with antiseptic and wait for 2-3 minutes.
4. Inject local anaesthesia under her skin along the intended insertion line of the implant. Do not go too deep.
5. Wait for 2-3 minutes before checking anaesthetic with point of needle.
6. Make a small incision with a scalpel or use the applicator to directly puncture the skin
7. Enter the skin at a shallow angle with the applicator and lift and straighten it to ‘tent’ the skin while gently pushing the device under the skin towards the second mark.
8. Do not to insert the implant too deep. If you feel any resistance, stop and try a different direction.
9. Hold the device still, insert the rod(s)
10. Once the rod(s) are in place, gently remove the applicator
11. Apply pressure with gauze and wrap with a bandage. Stitches are not needed.
12. Advise the woman to keep the incision area dry for 4 days.

### Implant removal

# Implant removal

Implants should be removed without delay at a woman’s request, regardless of where she is in her menstrual cycle. Her fertility will return immediately following removal.

## Sterile equipment

* Sterile field
* Ring forceps
* Straight forceps
* Curved forceps
* Gloves
* Metal bowl with cotton balls
* Antiseptic solution
* Scalpel
* Syringe with needle
* 2ml local anaesthetic (1% lidocaine)

![](/icon/procedure/non-sterile_equipment)

## Non-sterile equipment

* Pen

## Removal procedure

1. Gently locate the implant and mark the where the end closest to the elbow is on the woman’s skin. Pushing down on the other end should cause the implant to ‘pop-up’ (If implant cannot be felt, refer the woman for localization and removal)
2. Do not attempt to remove the implant until its exact location is identified
3. Follow infection prevention technique
4. Clean the skin with antiseptic solution
5. Inject a small amount of local anaesthetic under the skin of her arm at the incision site and wait 2-3 minutes
6. Make a shallow 4 mm incision in the skin close to the end of the implant, keeping the skin flat
7. Gently push the implant towards the incision with your fingers and use curved forceps to grasp it when the tip of it becomes visible
8. Gently use the scalpel to open the fibrous tissue capsule around the implant rod
9. Applying light pressure on the other end of the implant should cause it to ‘pop’ out of the capsule
10. Pull out the implant rod gently
11. Repeat the process for other rods if necessary
12. Cover site with a plaster and apply sterile gauze and compress to minimize bruising (stitches are not required)
13. If the woman needs a new implant, place it above or below the previous incision or in the other arm

### IUD/IUS insertion

# IUD/IUS insertion introduction

An IUD/IUS can be inserted at any time in the menstrual cycle if it is certain the woman is not pregnant and does not have chlamydia or gonorrhoea.  
  
It can be inserted within 48 hours following a birth (including caesarean section). If more than 48, delay until 4 weeks postnatal. It can also be inserted immediately after a surgical abortion, and after passage of products of conception following medical abortion has been confirmed.

## Documentation

A consent form should be signed by the client. Documentation should be complete and correct. Give a record card to the client with the following information:

* Type of IUD/IUS and date of insertion
* Date when the IUD/IUS will need to be removed or replaced
* Where to go if they have problems with or questions about their IUD/IUS

# Immediate postpartum IUD/IUS insertion

## Sterile equipment

* Sterile field
* Gloves
* 2 x Ring forceps
* Scissors
* Bowl with cotton balls
* Bowl with antiseptic solution
* IUD/IUS pack (including the device and insertion equipment)

![](/icon/procedure/insert_postpartum_IUD)

## Non-sterile equipment

* Headlight or surgical lamp

## Insertion procedure

1. Check for any delivery related contraindications (e.g., prolonged rupture of membranes (>18 hours), continuing postpartum haemorrhage, and chorioamnionitis)
2. The IUD/IUS is inserted after removal of placenta
3. Standard options for analgesia in labour and delivery can be used for the IUD insertion
4. Clean the perineal area
5. Palpate abdomen to assess the uterine height
6. Using a speculum, expose and visualise the anterior cervix
7. Gently grasp the anterior cervix with a ring forceps
8. Prepare for IUD/IUS insertion
9. Grasp IUD/IUS with new ring forceps at the T junction – do not lock the forceps as this may damage the IUD/IUS
10. Grasp it so that the stem and the strings are parallel to the forceps
11. The top of the IUD/IUS should be in line with the end of the forceps, and the strings guided away from the shaft of the forceps to avoid them being pulled when the forceps are removed
12. Some IUD/IUS applicators are long enough to use in the immediate postnatal period, so forceps may not always be needed for insertion
13. While retracting gently on the cervix and under direct visualisation, introduce the IUD/IUS through the cervix into the lower uterus
14. Release the hand that was retracting the cervix and place it on the abdomen
15. Stabilise the uterus with hand, adding light upward pressure to straighten the uterus
16. Advance the IUD/IUS to the uterine fundus
17. Confirm fundal placement with both abdominal hand and the inserting hand
18. Release the IUD/IUS from the forceps, opening them as wide as possible.
19. Withdraw the forceps along the right wall of the uterus to not pull out the device
20. Strings may or may not be visible at the cervical OS.

# Standard IUD/IUS insertion

## Sterile equipment

* Sterile field
* Gloves
* Ring forceps
* Narrow forceps
* Tenaculum (to hold the cervix)
* Uterine sound (to measure uterine depth)
* Scissors
* Bowl with cotton balls
* Bowl with antiseptic solution
* IUD/IUS pack (including the device and insertion equipment)

![](/icon/procedure/IUD_insertion)

## Non-sterile equipment

* Headlight or surgical lamp

## Insertion procedure

1. Provide oral paracetamol or ibuprofen 30 minutes before insertion
2. Use infection prevention (non-touch) technique
3. Do a bimanual examination to determine the position of the uterus
4. Gently insert speculum into the vagina to inspect the cervix
5. Clean cervix and vagina with antiseptic
6. Slowly insert the tenaculum through the speculum and gently grasp the cervix with the tenaculum
7. Confirm the uterine size and position by passing the sound through the cervix
8. Load the chosen IUD/IUS into inserter while both are still in the sterile package, inserting the rod up to the IUD/IUS base and setting the flange based on the uterine sound measurement
9. Insert the IUD/IUS using the inserter into the uterus until the flange is against the cervical os
10. Withdraw the inserter tube approximately 2cm on the insertion rod, keeping the rod fixed, and wait 10 seconds so that the IUD/IUS arms can spread open in a ‘T’ shape
11. Remove insertion rod
12. Move the insertion tube gently up to the fundus to ensure fundal placement of the IUD/IUS
13. Withdraw the insertion tube to leave the IUD/IUS in the cavity
14. Avoid perforation by withdrawing the insertion tube rather than pushing the insertion rod
15. Cut strings on the IUD/IUS, leaving about 3 cm hanging out of the cervix

![](/icon/procedure/IUD_insertion_procedure)![](/icon/procedure/insert_IUD)

# Post-insertion follow-up (3-6 weeks)

Ask if the woman if she is satisfied with the method and if she has questions. Ask her if she has:

* Bleeding changes
* Pain during sex/urination
* Unusual vaginal discharge
* Fever
* Signs/symptoms of pregnancy
* Routine pelvic examination is not required at the follow up.

# The non-touch technique

## IUD/IUS insertion

During IUD/IUS insertion, a non-touch technique means not letting the loaded inserter or uterine sound touch any unsterile surface (hands, speculum, vagina, tabletop etc), and involves:

* Loading the IUD/IUS into the inserter while the device is still in the sterile package, to avoid direct contact
* Cleaning the cervix thoroughly with antiseptic before insertion
* Being careful not to touch the vaginal wall or speculum blades with the uterine sound or loaded inserter
* Passing the uterine sound and loaded inserter only once each through the cervical canal

### IUD/IUS removal

# IUD/IUS removal

Never refuse or delay IUD removal when a woman requests it. Removing IUD can be done any time in her menstrual cycle. The procedure is the same for all IUD/IUS types.   
  
The woman’s fertility will return with no delay following removal.

## Equipment

* Speculum
* Antiseptic solution
* Ring forceps
* Cotton tip swab

## Procedure

1. Inform the woman that she may experience cramps for a short while as it comes out
2. Woman much lie flat on their back, in a private and clean environment
3. Insert speculum gently into the vagina to visualise the cervix and IUD/IUS strings
4. (If the strings are not located, gently prove the cervical canal with cotton tip swap. If they cannot be found curled up in the canal, perform a pregnancy test and refer to a higher facility for further management)
5. Carefully clean the cervix and vagina with antiseptic
6. Ask the woman to take slow, deep breaths and relax.
7. Grasp the strings with ring forceps at the cervical os under direct vision.
8. Gently but steadily pull the strings until the IUD comes completely out of the cervix
9. Another IUD/IUS can be inserted immediately following removal if desired by the woman.
10. (If significant resistance is felt during removal, stop the procedure and refer the client to a higher facility for further management)

## Drugs

### Copper intrauterine device (IUD)

## Introduction

A small, T-shaped plastic and copper device that is inserted into the uterus, that damages sperm and prevents ovulation.

An IUD works as soon as it is put in and lasts for 5-10 years, depending on the brand.

## Examples of brands

ParaGard, Liberté, FlexiT, and Monalisa.

## Common side-effects

Changes in bleeding pattern (typically more irregular, longer and heavier bleeding, with more painful cramps)

## More information

See packaging for specific guidance on each medication.

---

### Combined contraceptive patch

## Introduction

A small sticky patch that releases hormones into the body through the skin that prevent ovulation and therefore pregnancy.

## Medication examples

* **Norelgestromin + ethinyl estradiol** (Evra/Ortho Evra)

## Common side-effects

Some report skin irritation, itching and soreness. Side-effects such as bleeding between periods, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness and mood changes can occur temporarily and usually settle after a few months.

## More information

See packaging for specific guidance on each medication.

---

### Combined oral contraceptives

## Introduction

Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) contain artificial versions of female hormones oestrogen and progesterone, prevents the sperm from ovulating the egg by preventing ovulation, thickening cervical mucus, and thinning the uterine lining.

Types of COCs include monophasic, phasic or every-day (ED) medications depending on the dose and frequency.

## Medication examples

COCs contain a combination of ethinyl estradiol and either:

* **Levonorgestrel** (Microgynon/Microgynon ED/Elevin/Levest/Logynon)
* **Gestodene** (Akizza/Femodene/Katya/Millinette)
* **Drospirenone** (Yasmin/Dretine/Lucette/Yacella)
* **Desogestrel** (Marvelon/Cimizt/Gedarel/Apri 28-Day/Reclipsen 28-Day)
* **Norgestimate** (Cilique/Lizinna/Cilest)

## Common side-effects

Some have reported experiencing headaches, nausea, dizziness, breast tenderness.

## More information

See packaging for specific guidance on each medication.

---

### Emergency contraceptive pills

## Introduction

Emergency contraception (EC) can prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex, following contraceptive misuse or failure (split condom or missed pill), rape or coerced sex by preventing or delaying the release of eggs from the ovaries.

## Medications (from highest to lowest effectiveness)

* Copper IUD for EC
* Oral **ulipristal acetate** (Ella/ellaOne)
* Oral **mifepristone** oral tablet
* Oral **levonorgestrel** (Plan B/Levonelle)
* Yuzpe method: **ethinyl estradiol + levonorgestrel** combination

## Common side-effects

Some may experience headaches, abdominal pain, short term changes to bleeding patterns, nausea and vomiting.

## Contraindication

After intake of the Oral ulipristal acetate (Ella/ellaOne) breastfeeding is not recommended for one week.

## More information

See medication guidelines packed with medication for more specific guidance.

---

### Hormonal intrauterine system (IUS)

A small, T-shaped plastic device that, when inserted into the uterus, steadily releases a form of synthetic progesterone (progestin) each day.

It works by thickening cervical mucus, thinning the uterine lining and, for some, preventing ovulation each month, making pregnancy very unlikely.

An IUS lasts for 3-5 years, depending on the brand.

## Medication

**Levonorgestrel** (Merina, Kyleena, Liletta, Skyla, and Jaydess)

## Common side-effects

Some users report: changes in bleeding patterns, headaches, acne, breast tenderness, mood changes, weight gain and dizziness.

Some may develop ovarian cysts (these usually disappear without treatment).

## More information

See packaging for specific guidance on each medication.

---

### Implants

## Introduction

1-2 small plastic rods that are inserted under the skin in the upper arm that work by steadily releasing progestin that thickens cervical mucous, preventing sperm from reaching and ovulating the egg cell.

An implant last for 3-5 years, depending on the brand.
