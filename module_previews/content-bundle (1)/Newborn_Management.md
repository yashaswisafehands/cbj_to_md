* Monitor the newborn closely.
* Check breathing and colour every 15 min.
* Check the cord for bleeding every 15 min, keep it clean and dry. If bleeding, retie it.
* Give **1 mg** **Vitamin K** (IM). **1 mg** for newborns weighing more than 1500 grams and **0,5 mg** for newborns weighing less than 1500 grams.
* Start breastfeeding within the first hour after birth and let the newborn feed on demand.
* Examine the newborn, look for danger signs.
* Give vaccines according to national protocol.
* Apply Antibiotic Eye Ointment and Chlorhexidine digluconate to the umbilical cord, if relevant to the local context.
* Weigh the newborn, if less than 2.5 kg consider the newborn low birth weight and at risk of complications such as low blood sugar, respiratory distress, and severe infections. Admit and monitor closely for danger signs, consider referral to a facility with advanced care.
* See Low Birth Weight module for further details.
* If clinically stable manage with Kangaroo Mother Care: continuous and prolonged skin-to-skin contact with the mother or another caregiver. Initiate at the hospital and continue at home.

At discharge ask the mother to return if the newborn shows any danger signs.

REMEMBER

At any danger sign or slightest suspicion, treat immediately with antibiotics. The first dose is Ampicillin 50 mg per kg and Gentamicin 5 mg per kg IV or IM (3 mg Gentamicin per kg if newborn weighs below 2.5 kg).  
  
Only if families do not accept or cannot access referral care alternative treatment schedules using oral antibiotics can be used.

Treatment must be administrated by an appropriately trained health worker

* If referral is impossible young infants 0–6 days old with fast breathing, >60 breaths per minute, as the only sign of illness should be treated with or**al Amoxicillin 50 mg/kg per d**ose given twice daily for seven days.

* Young infants 7–59 days old with fast breathing, >60 breaths per minute, as the only sign of illness should be treated with or**al Amoxicillin 50 mg/kg per d**ose given twice daily for seven days. These infants do not need referral.

* Young infants 0-59 days old with clinically severe infection should be treated by either schedule 1 or 2:

1. **IM Gentamicin 5-7.5 mg/kg** (**3 mg/kg** for low birth weight infants) once daily for seven days and twice daily oral **Amoxicillin 50mg/kg per dose** for seven days. Close follow up is essential.
2. **IM Gentamicin 5-7.5 mg/kg** (**3 mg/kg** for low birth weight infants) once daily for three days and twice daily oral **Amoxicillin 50 mg/kg** per dose for seven days. Close follow up is essential. A careful assessment on day 4 is mandatory.

### Fluid management of newborns

The total daily volume of fluids (ml/kg/day) required by a newborn is determined by weight and day of life.

The total daily volume of fluids is spread over 24 hours. It is composed of either enteral only, intravenous only or a combination of the two.

The maximum fluid volume in intravenous fluids for a newborn is 150 ml/kg/day.

The usual maximum oral intake for a newborn is 180 ml/kg/day.

The reference weight is the birthweight until the birth weight is exceeded.

---

Total daily fluid requirements in ml/kg/day (accumulated oral, nasogastric tube, IV)

![](/richtext/daily_fluid_requirements)

---

If very low birth weight or not able to tolerate oral feeds give IV **10% glucose solution**.

After the first two days of life change to **half saline** or **5% dextrose**.

Reintroduce expressed breast milk feeds slowly, and gradually increase by 1-2 ml per feed each day.

If IV fluids are given, reduce the rate as the volume of oral or gastric milk feeds increases and when sucking well at the breast and gaining weight reduce the cup or gastric tube feeds.

---

### Safe Oxygen Therapy

### Safe oxygen therapy

Hypoxaemia means low levels of oxygen in the blood and is a life-threatening condition. It occurs in neonates with birth asphyxia and respiratory distress syndrome as well as infections such as severe pneumonia and sepsis.

The normal range of SpO2 is 94-100%. It may take an hour after delivery for oxygen saturation to reach >90% for newborns.

Use pulse oximetry whenever possible. It is recommended for determining the presence of hypoxaemia and for guiding administration of oxygen therapy to neonates, infants, and children. Give oxygen if:

* Oxygen saturation <90%

If pulse oximetry is not available, the following clinical signs could be used to determine use of oxygen therapy.

* Central cyanosis
* Nasal flaring
* Inability to drink or feed (when due to respiratory distress)
* Grunting with every breath
* Depressed mental state is drowsy and/or lethargic

In some situations, and depending on the overall clinical condition, children with the following less-specific signs may also need oxygen:

* Severe lower chest wall indrawing
* Respiratory rate >70/min (age 2 months to 5 years)
* Head nodding (i.e. a nodding movement of the head in synch with respiration and indicating severe respiratory distress)

---

### Oxygen delivery methods

Nasal prongs are the preferred method of delivering oxygen to infants and children   
<5 years of age with hypoxaemia who require oxygen therapy.

Where nasal prongs are not available, nasal or nasopharyngeal catheters can be used as alternative delivery methods. Face masks and head boxes are not recommended.

Standard flow rates for oxygen through nasal prongs or nasal catheters are:

* 0.5-1 L/min for neonates. Maximum flow rate without humidification is 1/min in neonates.
* 1-2 L/min for infants
* 1-4 L/min for older children

---

### Monitoring

Administration of oxygen therapy should be guided by pulse oximetry, when available.

The normal oxygen level for newborns in the first hours of life is >88%.

In preterm infants born at <32 weeks’ gestation, oxygen levels should be maintained between 88% and 95% and NOT above 95%, in order to avoid eye damage (retinopathy).

Oxygen therapy should be discontinued in a clinically stable child once oxygen saturation remains stable above the recommended level of 90% for at least 15 min in room air.

Do not discharge the child until their oxygen levels have been stable at >90% for at least 24 hours AND until all danger signs have resolved.

---

### Emergency Referral for Newborn

### Emergency referral for newborns

Emergency!

Do not refer if emergency is not controlled!

After emergency management and when in a stable condition, discuss decision of referral with the mother and relatives.

If a newborn is in need of referral; give the recommended antibiotics prior to referral.

Before and during referral it is important to keep the newborn warm. Use either skin-to-skin contact or wrap in a soft, dry, cloth and blanket, ensuring that the head is covered.

Initiate breastfeeding or provide alternative breastmilk feeding.

If in a facility where there is neonatal ICU refer the newborn after 5 minutes of ventilation with bag and mask. Continue ventilation while referring the newborn. If referral is impossible, continue neonatal resuscitation. See Action Card Neonatal Resuscitation.

Inform the referral center.

Accompany the mother with the newborn.

It is crucial that the newborn is accompanied by a health worker who is trained in managing an emergency situation.

Quickly organize transport and possible financial aid.

Consider to bring a relative who can donate blood.

---

### Bring

Referral note.

## Essential emergency drugs:

* **Oxytocin** and **Ergometrine** (alternatively **Misoprostol**) for treatment of post partum haemorrhage
* **Hydralazine** for IV treatment of elevated blood pressure
* **Magnesium Sulphate** for eclampsia
* **Calcium Gluconate** for intoxication with **Magnesium Sulphate**
* **Ampicillin, Gentamycin** and **Metronidazole** for infections
* **Diazepam** for pain relief
* **Phenobarbital** for the newborn in case of convulsions
* **Adrenaline** for the newborn in case of cardiac arrest

## Supplies:

* Towel
* IV-equipment + IV fluids
* Neonatal ambu bag with appropriate mask size
* Suction bulb
* Syringes of different sizes
* Examination and sterile gloves

---

### During Transport

![](/key learning points/Manual removal of placenta/ambulance)

Observe vital signs and level of consciousness.

Ensure to prevent and treat convulsion, hypoglycemia and hypothermia.

If the newborn’s condition permits:

Keep record of all IV fluids, medications given, time of administration and the newborn´s condition.

---

## Procedures

### Intravenous access equipment

### Intravenous access - usage

Intravenous access is used to administer fluids and drugs.

Equipment for intravenous access should be located in the delivery room.

It should be available at all health facilities for adults as well as newborn.

It includes:

**Antiseptic solution** to clean the surrounding skin, syringes, intravenous cannulas, a stasis hose/band, tapes, gauze and cannulas.

### Intravenous Access - Practical information

### Adults:

The grey (gauge 16) and green (gauge 18) cannulas have a large diameter.

Using them makes the fluid enter the veines more rapidly.

---

### Newborns:

For insertion of an intravenous cannula in the neonate select a suitable vein to place the cannula or a gauge 21 or 23 butterfly needle.

![](/richtext/pp_iv_baby_english_text)

---

### Peripheral vein:

* Identify an accessible peripheral vein, see illustration.

* An assistant should keep the position of the limb steady and should act as a tourniquet by obstructing the venous return with his or her fingers lightly closed around the limb. Alternatively use a stasis hose/band.

* Clean the surrounding skin with an **antiseptic solution** (such as **spirit**, **iodine**, **isopropyl alcohol** or **70 % alcohol solution**), then introduce the cannula into the vein and insert most of its length. Fix the catheter securely with tape. Apply a splint with the limb in an appropriate position (e.g. elbow extended, wrist slightly flexed).

![](/richtext/pp_iv_baby)

---

### Scalp vein:

These are often used in children under 2 years of age.

* Find a suitable scalp vein (usually in the midline of the forehead, the temporal area or above or behind the ear).

* Shave the area if necessary, and clean the skin with an **antiseptic solution**. The assistant should occlude the vein proximal to the site of puncture. Fill a syringe and leave the end of the tubing open. Introduce the butterfly needle as described above. Blood flowing back slowly through the tubing indicates that the needle is in the vein.

* Care should be taken not to cannulate an artery, which is recognised by palpation. If there is a pulsatile spurting of blood, withdraw the needle and apply pressure until the bleeding stops; then look for the vein.

---

### Nasogastric tube

### Nasogastric tube - Usage

A nasogastric (NG) tube provides access to the stomach and its contents.

NG tubes can also be used for enteral feeding of infants.

It also enables you to drain gastric contents, decompress the stomach, obtain a specimen of the gastric contents, or introduce a passage into the GI tract.

All necessary equipment should be prepared, assembled and available at the table prior to starting the nasogastric tube.

Basic equipment includes:

* Personal protective equipment
* NG tube
* Catheter tip irrigation 60ml syringe
* Water-soluble lubricant, preferably **2% Xylocaine jelly**. Alternatively use water.
* Adhesive tape
* Stethoscope
* pH indicator strips

### Nasogastric tube - Practical information

### Insertion of a nasogastric tube:

* Holding the tip of the tube against the child’s nose, measure the distance from the nose to the ear lobe, then to the xiphisternum (epigastrium). Mark the tube at this point.

* Hold the child firmly. Lubricate the tip of the catheter with water, and pass it directly into one nostril, pushing it slowly in. It should pass easily down into the stomach without resistance. When the measured distance is reached, fix the tube with tape at the nose.

* Aspirate a small amount of stomach contents with a syringe to confirm that the tube is in place (if available check that it turns blue lithmus paper pink). If no aspirate is obtained, inject air down the tube and listen over the abdomen with a stethoscope.

* If there is any doubt about the location of the tube, withdraw it and start again.

* When the tube is in place, fix a 20 ml syringe (without the plunger) to the end of the tube, and pour food or fluid into the syringe, allowing it to flow by gravity.

* If oxygen therapy is to be given by nasopharyngeal catheter at the same time, pass both tubes down the same nostril and try to keep the other nostril patent by wiping away crusts and secretions, or pass the feeding tube through the mouth.

### Breastfeeding

### Breastfeeding

Encourage skin-to-skin contact between mother and newborn soon after delivery.

Help the mother to put the newborn to the breast right away.

Start breastfeeding as soon as possible within the first hour after birth.

Check positioning, attachment, and suckling.

Give practical breastfeeding support.

Help the mother with common breastfeeding problems.

Support the mother to breastfeed by:

* Letting the mother and newborn stay together day and night.
* Making sure that mothers of sick newborns can stay near them.

Help the mother know when the newborn is hungry.

Do not limit breastfeeding times.

Feed on demand.

Feed completely on one breast, then shift to the other breast.

---

### Correct attachment

The newborn is well attached to the mother’s breast when:

* Chin is touching the breast.
* Mouth is wide open.
* Lower lip is turned outward.
* More areola is visible above than below the mouth.

![](/richtext/AC_breastfeeding_correct_attachment)

---

### Wrong attachment

![](/richtext/AC_breastfeeding_wrong_attachment)

---

Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months; continue breastfeeding for two years.

Support the mother to breastfeed by giving only breastmilk unless there are medical reasons.

Support a mother who wants to formula feed to do so safely.

### Antibiotic Eye Ointment

# Indications and Usage

For prophylaxis of ophthalmia neonatorum due to N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including gonorrhea and chlamydia are a main cause of newborn eye infections (the newborn can get transmitted during delivery).

These infections can cause blindness if not treated.

Give antibiotic eye drops or ointment (e.g. Erythromycin Ophtalmic Ointment) to the newborn to prevent eye infections.

# Dosage and Administration

**For prophylaxis** of neonatal gonococcal or chlamydial ophthalmia, a ribbon of ointment approximately 1 cm in length should be instilled into each lower conjunctival sac.

The ointment should not be flushed from the eye following instillation.

A new tube should be used for each infant.

**For treatment of eye infection:**

Do the following 6-8 times daily:

* Wash hands with clean water and soap.
* Wet clean cloth with boiled and cooled water.
* Use the wet cloth to gently wash off pus from the baby’s eyes.
* Apply 1% tetracycline eye ointment in each eye 3 times daily.
* Wash hands.

# Contraindications

None

# Adverse Reactions

The most frequently reported adverse reactions are minor ocular irritations, redness and hypersensitivity reactions.

# Contraindications

Allergy to cephalosporins. Severe reactions to penicillin (anaphylactic reactions)

Neonates ( ≤ 28 days), hyperbilirubinaemic neonates, especially prematures, should not be treated with ceftriaxone.

In vitro studies have shown that ceftriaxone can displace bilirubin from its binding to serum albumin, leading to a possible risk of bilirubin encephalopathy in these patients.

**Ceftriaxone is contraindicated in neonates if they require (or are expected to require) treatment with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium.**

# Adverse reactions

Common adverse reactions are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, skin rash, and itching.

Uncommon reactions are headache, dizziness, and urticaria.

Rare reactions are lowered platelets, necrosis of the skin, drug fever, candidiasis, haemolytic anaemia and hearing loss.
