### Procedure for vacuum extraction

### Procedure for vacuum extraction

## Go through A-J

---

Ask for help.

Address the patient, tell her and her companion what you are about to do while you continue to prepare, tell her that you need her to cooperate and keep pushing when there is a contraction.

Abdominal palpation – the head should not be palpable more than 1/5 above the pubic bone.

---

Bladder empty.

---

Check that Cervix is fully dilated.

Contractions – there must be contractions to succeed.

---

Determine position – locate the posterior fontanel (triangular shaped) with your index finger. This is important to place the cup correctly.

---

Equipment ready – delivery tray, **Oxytocin 10 IU** for IM injection to the mother, towels, neonatal resuscitator, and vacuum extractor.

---

Flexion Point – most cups are 3 cm from the center to the edge. Place the edge of the cup at the tip of the posterior triangular fontanel.

Feel for vaginal tissue between the cup and the foetal skull before and after applying suction to avoid trauma to the vagina.

---

Gentle, steady traction with no rocking during a contraction; with the first contractions downward. During the following contractions, more upward.

---

Halt in between contractions.

HALT and abandon if three pop-offs, or if three pulls with no progress, or if 30 minutes from application delivery is not achieved.

---

Intact perineum!

When the head is delivered during the next contraction protect perineum with one hand; squeeze the index and thumb together at the posterior part of the head to prevent stretching of the perineum and lift the head with your third finger upward and away from the perineum, while the other hand keeps the head from coming too fast.

An Incision is only rarely needed.

---

Jaw reachable – release the vacuum and remove the cup.

---

### Emergency Referral - Prolonged Labour

### Emergency referral for prolonged labour

Emergency!

Do not refer if emergency is not controlled.

Refer the mother to a higher facility if the baby is undelivered within 15 minutes of effective application of vacuum extraction, if there is no progress in station of the presenting part after effective pulls with vacuum extraction or if there is three pop-offs.

After emergency management and when in a stable condition, discuss decision of referral with woman and relatives.

Quickly organize transport and possible financial aid.

Inform the referral center.

Accompany the woman.

It is crucial that the woman is accompanied by a health worker who is trained in delivery care and able to manage an emergency situation.

Consider to bring a relative who can donate blood.

---

### Bring

Referral note.

## Essential emergency drugs:

* **Oxytocin** and **Ergometrine** (alternatively **Misoprostol**) for treatment of post-partum haemorrhage
* **Oxytocin** for IM injection immediately post partum
* **Hydralazine** for IV treatment of elevated blood pressure
* **Magnesium Sulphate** for eclampsia
* **Calcium Gluconate** for intoxication with **Magnesium Sulphate**
* **Ampicillin**, **Gentamicin** and **Metronidazole** for infections
* **Diazepam** for pain relief
* **Phenobarbital** for the newborn in case of convulsions
* **Adrenaline** for the newborn in case of cardiac arrest

## Supplies:

* Delivery set
* Towels
* IV-equipment + IV fluids
* Blood pressure monitor
* Adult and newborn ambu bag with appropriate mask sizes
* Suction bulb
* Syringes of different sizes
* Examination and sterile gloves

---

### During Transport

![](/key learning points/Manual removal of placenta/ambulance)

Observe vital signs and level of consciousness.

Position her on left side and ensure hydration.

If the woman’s condition permits:

Keep record of all IV fluids, medications given, time of administration and the woman´s condition.

### If in labour during transport

If pushing and superficial breathing is not enough to repress this urge, stop the transport and deliver the woman.

---

## Procedures

### Urinary catheter

### Urinary catheter - usage

Catheterize only when necessary.   
  
Emptying the bladder with a urinary catheter is indicated:

1. If a woman in labour fails to urinate spontaneously and the progress of labour is dissatisfactory, **OR**
2. Prior to applying vacuum extrator **OR**
3. In cases of postpartum haemorrhage, **AND**
4. In any servere condition such as maternal sepsis or severe preeclampsia/eclampsia to monitor the urine output. In this case, the catheter should stay in place until the condition improves (indwelling urinary catheter).

# Indwelling Urinary Catheter

![](/richtext/urine_catheter)

## Practical information

An indwelling urinary catheter is a catheter that is inserted into the bladder via the urethra and left in the bladder to drain urine.

All women in a critical condition (sepsis, severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, bleeding, shock) must have an indwelling urinary catheter, and the hourly urine output should be at least 30 ml.

If less, the underlying cause should be treated and fluid replacement considered, although not more than 80 ml per hour (oral and IV) should be given for women with preeclampsia as the risk of fluid overload and pulmonary oedema increases.

## Procedure

1. Perform handwashing prior to the procedure and apply gloves.
2. The woman should be lying on her back with knees flexed and thighs relaxed.
3. Place a blanket/sheet to cover the woman as much as possible.
4. If available, cover the woman in sterile drape.
5. Apply sterile gloves.
6. Separate the labia with one hand and expose urethral opening.
7. The area around the urethra should be cleaned twice with gauze swabs and normal saline water.
8. Lubricate catheter.
9. Insert the catheter into the urethral opening.
10. Inflate the balloon slowly by using sterile water to reach the volume recommended on the catheter.
11. **ALWAYS** ensure urine is flowing before inflating the balloon.
12. Pull back the catheter slightly until resistance is felt and attach it to the drainage system with the urine bag.
13. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.

## Removal

1. Explain the procedure to the woman.
2. Ensure privacy and have the woman placed on her back or on a toilet.
3. Perform hand hygiene and put on gloves.
4. Deflate the balloon completely or cut the catheter at the ballon inflation point to ensure the ballon is deflated.
5. Gently pull back the catheter.
6. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
7. Observe urine output after removal of catheter.
8. The woman should urinate spontanously 4-6 hours after the removal.

# Intermittent Urinary Catheter

## Practical Information

Intemittent urinary catheter is inserted at regular intervals or when urination is required but the women is not able to empty the bladder herself.

## Procedure

1. Perform handwashing prior to the procedure.
2. The woman should be lying on her back with knees flexed and thighs relaxed.
3. Place a blanket/sheet to cover the woman as much as possible.
4. If available, cover the woman in sterile drape.
5. Apply sterile gloves.
6. Separate labia with one hand and expose urethral opening.
7. The area around the urethra should be cleaned twice with gauze swabs and normal saline water.
8. Lubricate catheter.
9. Insert catheter into the urethral opening.
10. Empty the womans bladder and remove the catheter.
11. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
12. Note down the urine volume.

### Foetal heart rate

### Foetal heart rate - usage

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_Monitoring)

Measurement of the foetal heart rate at birth is indicated:

**1)** On admission,

**2)** During the 1st stage of labour: Every **30 minutes** for mothers and foetuses at low risk, and every **15 minutes** if any risk is identified for the mother or foetus.

**3)** During 2nd stage: Immediately after every contraction and at least every **5 minutes.**

### Foetal heart rate - normal values

The lower limit for a normal foetal heart rate is defined as 110 beats per minute (bpm).

A heart rate below 100 bpm indicates foetal asphyxia and immediate delivery is necessary.

The upper limit for a normal heart rate is 160 bpm.

A heart rate above 180 bpm indicates foetal asphyxia and immediate delivery is necessary.

### Foetal heart rate - practical information

The foetal heart is best heard by placing the foetoscope over the back of the foetus. You should therefore establish the lie and position of the foetus before listening to the foetal heart.

![](/richtext/PP_NLB_The_position_of_the_back_of_the_fetus)

Always measure the foetal heart rate for one minute immediately after a contraction (you will need a watch).

Measuring the maternal pulse and the foetal heart rate simultaneously can help avoid a mix-up between the two.

---

### Vacuum extractor

### Vacuum Extractor - Usage

Vacuum delivery is a Basic Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care signal function, and must be mastered by all skilled birth attendants.

### Indications

1. Foetal heart rate remaining below 100 or above 180 beat per minute.
2. Maternal exhaustion.
3. Pushing for more than one hour with strong contractions.
4. Maternal heart disease or hypertension (these patients should be giving birth in a referral facility).

### Prerequisites

1. Cephalic presentation not more than 1/5 palpable above the pubic bone.
2. Cervix fully dilated.
3. Membranes ruptured.
4. Empty bladder.
5. Gestational age 36 weeks or more.
6. Relevant expertise.
7. Willingness to stop.

### Vacuum extractor - practical information

Different types of vacuum extractors exist.

Most frequently used are the ones with metal or silicon cups and the hand-pump suction devices with a plastic cup.

Both can be used safely, the hand-pump devices have the benefit of the practitioner being in control for creating the vacuum, whilst with the other device an assistant is needed to operate the pump.

Metal and plastic cups are less likely to “pop off” and therefore the risk of failure is only half compared to the soft silicon cups.

---

### Procedure

With the suction off, the center of the cup should be applied 3 cm anterior to the posterior fontanel in the midline along the sagittal suture, the so-called the flexion point.

![](/key learning points/Prolonged labour/correct_way_to_place_the_cup)

The flexion point is an important point in maximising traction and minimising detachment of the cup.

As most cups have a diameter of 5 to 7 cm the edge of the cup will be over the posterior fontanel.

No maternal tissue, including the vagina, should be under the cup.

The risk of subgaleal haemorrhage increases if the cup edge is placed on the sagittal suture.

Improper application appears to be common with attempted vacuum assisted delivery and is thought to be a primary factor in unsuccessful attempts.

The vertex is wiped clean of blood and fluid.

The labia are spread, and the cup is gently inserted.

A finger is swept around the cup to make sure no maternal tissue is trapped beneath the cup.

Then vacuum is applied.

For the whole procedure, go through the Action Card "Procedure for vacuum extraction"

---

### Complications

A vacuum assisted delivery is not a procedure without any risks, and should therefore be used when indications and prerequisites exist.

Proper application of vacuum is essential.

Both mother and newborn should be examined for birth trauma after its application.

Traction can speed up delivery in emergency situations only when there is cooperation from the mother with pushing.

Proper traction at right angles to the plane of the vacuum cup, and in the axis of traction, is necessary to avoid losing the vacuum.

One type of complication of vacuum delivery is subgaleal haematoma, on rare occasions it may be life threatening.

This occurs when emissary veins are damaged and blood accumulates in the potential space between the galea aponeurotica and the periosteum of the skull.

Signs of subgaleal haematomas include diffuse swelling of the head that may shift dependently when the infant’s head is repositioned.

This swelling indents easily on palpation and may be significant enough to result in hypovolemic shock.

It is treated with a pressure bandage and replacement of volume if needed.

Subgaleal haematoma is quite different than a cephalohematoma, which is a collection of blood that accumulates under the periosteum of a skull bone (usually the parietal) and is characteristically limited to the confines of the cranial bone and therefore the amount of bleeding will not become dangerous.

Intracranial haemorrhage is a rare complication that may be life threatening, the risk is higher in the severely premature baby, therefore vacuum extraction should ideally not be applied before 36 weeks of gestation.

Vacuum delivery also increases the risk of maternal trauma, so the procedure should be performed only on a well established indication and assess carefully any trauma to the birth canal especially the anal sphincter by performing a rectal digital exploration.

### Intravenous access equipment

### Intravenous access - usage

Intravenous access is used to administer fluids and drugs.

Equipment for intravenous access should be located in the delivery room.

It should be available at all health facilities for adults as well as newborn.

It includes:

**Antiseptic solution** to clean the surrounding skin, syringes, intravenous cannulas, a stasis hose/band, tapes, gauze and cannulas.

### Intravenous Access - Practical information

### Adults:

The grey (gauge 16) and green (gauge 18) cannulas have a large diameter.

Using them makes the fluid enter the veines more rapidly.

---

### Newborns:

For insertion of an intravenous cannula in the neonate select a suitable vein to place the cannula or a gauge 21 or 23 butterfly needle.

![](/richtext/pp_iv_baby_english_text)

---

### Peripheral vein:

* Identify an accessible peripheral vein, see illustration.

* An assistant should keep the position of the limb steady and should act as a tourniquet by obstructing the venous return with his or her fingers lightly closed around the limb. Alternatively use a stasis hose/band.

* Clean the surrounding skin with an **antiseptic solution** (such as **spirit**, **iodine**, **isopropyl alcohol** or **70 % alcohol solution**), then introduce the cannula into the vein and insert most of its length. Fix the catheter securely with tape. Apply a splint with the limb in an appropriate position (e.g. elbow extended, wrist slightly flexed).

![](/richtext/pp_iv_baby)

---

### Scalp vein:

These are often used in children under 2 years of age.

* Find a suitable scalp vein (usually in the midline of the forehead, the temporal area or above or behind the ear).

* Shave the area if necessary, and clean the skin with an **antiseptic solution**. The assistant should occlude the vein proximal to the site of puncture. Fill a syringe and leave the end of the tubing open. Introduce the butterfly needle as described above. Blood flowing back slowly through the tubing indicates that the needle is in the vein.

* Care should be taken not to cannulate an artery, which is recognised by palpation. If there is a pulsatile spurting of blood, withdraw the needle and apply pressure until the bleeding stops; then look for the vein.

# Dosage and administration

Prevention of postpartum haemorrhage (for all women who have delivered):

10 units (1 ml) of Oxytocin given IM immediately after delivery of the baby.

Treatment of postpartum haemorrhage:

20 IU of Oxytocin added to 1 litre IV fluid (normal saline or Ringer’s lactate). Infuse as fast as possible.

Continuing IV dose:

Infuse 20 units of Oxytocin in 1 litre IV fluids at 40 drops per minute.

Maximum dose:

Not more than 3 litres of IV fluids containing Oxytocin.

---

Store Oxytocin at a temperature between 2 and 8°C.

# Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to Oxytocin.

# Adverse reactions

Common adverse reactions are cardiac arrhythmia, nausea, and vomiting.

Rare complications are severe water intoxication which can lead to convulsions and coma and even death, anaphylactic reaction and the loss of clotting factors (fibrinogen) in the blood leading to bleeding complications.
