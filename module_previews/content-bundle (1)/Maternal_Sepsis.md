# Module: Maternal Sepsis

## Action Cards

### Diagnosis of Sepsis

### Diagnosis of Sepsis

Two out of three must be present to diagnose sepsis in a case where there is a suspicion of infection:

* Systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg and/or
* Respiratory rate at or above 22 and/or
* Any altered state of consciousness (for example drowsiness)

---

Septic Shock is diagnosed at the following findings despite adequate fluid resuscitation:

* Systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg, OR;
* Urine output below 30 ml per hour.
* Pulse 110 beats per minute or more
Other symptoms of shock include: Pale skin, sweatiness or cold clammy skin, rapid breathing, any altered state of consciousness (for example drowsiness)

---

### Emergency Management

### Emergency Management

At signs of septic abortion

Evacuation of the uterus must be performed with no delay.

Do not delay by awaiting  
“antibiotic coverage”!

---

**CALL FOR HELP**

---

### Airway

Position so airway is not occluded or the patient at risk of aspiration.

---

### Breathing

If gasping or absent ventilate with bag and mask.

---

### Circulation

Insert 2 wide bore IV cannulas.

Give at least **2 L fluids IV, Normal Saline or Hartmann's solution** in the first hour.

Insert indwelling urine catheter to monitor in- and output.

---

### Drugs

Antibiotics intravenous according to local guidelines, for example:

**Ampicillin 2 g/6 hrs**

AND

**Gentamicin 240 mg/24 hrs**

AND

**Metronidazole 500 mg/8 hrs**

---

If in a malaria risk area,   
treat according to local guidelines.

**Chloramphenicol** should be avoided in pregnant and lactating women.

---

### Monitoring: Maternal sepsis

### Monitoring: Maternal sepsis

* Assess vital signs every half hour until stabilized.

* Intravenous fluid treatment is important.
* Give **2-6 litres Normal Saline or Hartmann's solution** over the next 12 hours to maintain a satisfactory blood pressure of at least 90 mmHg systolic and an average urine output of at least 50 ml per hour.

* Assess the fluid balance:

* Record all oral and intravenous input.
* Record all urinary, faeces and vomiting output.
* Add to output 1 liter at no fever and 1½ liter at fever because of perspiration.

---

### Identify Cause

### Identify cause

**Go through the six W’s:**

---

### Womb

At chorioamnionitis delivery should ideally be terminated within 12 hours.

At endometritis (puerperal sepsis) evacuation of the uterus (MVA or D&E) if no improvement after 24 hours.

---

### Weaning

Mastitis or abscess.

Treat with **Dicloxacillin** and empty the breasts.

---

### Wind

Pneumonia

Treat with **Penicillin**.

---

### Water

Urosepsis

Treat with **Chloramphenicol** and **Gentamicin.**  
  
**Septrin** can be used if a women presents with just dysuria and with no signs of organ dysfunction, fever or shock.

---

### Wound

**Flucloxacillin** 500mg every 6 hours OR **Clindomycin** 150mg every 6 hours OR **Erythromycin** 500mg every 8 hours, consider wound revision.

---

### Wings

Treat malaria according to local guidelines if positive test.

Also think of meningitis (neck stiffness), cholecystitis (right upper abdominal pain) and appendicitis (right lower abdominal pain, though could be at level of umbilicus when pregnant). Start treatment and refer to a higher-level facility.

Treat with **IV antibiotics** for 48 hours after the woman is fever free, then **oral antibiotics** for 5-7 days or more depending on the diagnosis.

---

Ensure that the HIV status of all women is known, and that appropriate antiretroviral therapy protocols are followed.

---

### Emergency Referral - Maternal Sepsis

### Emergency referral for maternal sepsis

Emergency!

Never refer a patient with maternal sepsis or septic shock without providing pre-referral management steps.

After emergency management and when in a stable condition, discuss decision of referral with woman and relatives.

Quickly organize transport and possible financial aid.

Inform the referral center.

Accompany the woman.

It is crucial that the woman is accompanied by a health worker who is trained in delivery care and able to manage an emergency situation, if it occurs or resurrects during transport.

Consider to bring a relative who can donate blood.

---

### Bring

Referral note.

## Essential emergency drugs:

* **Oxytocin** and **Ergometrine** (alternatively **Misoprostol**) for treatment of post-partum haemorrhage
* **Hydralazine** for IV treatment of elevated blood pressure
* **Magnesium Sulphate** for eclampsia
* **Calcium Gluconate** for intoxication with **Magnesium Sulphate**
* **Ampicillin**, **Gentamicin** and **Metronidazole** for infections
* **Diazepam** for pain relief
* **Phenobarbital** for the newborn in case of convulsions
* **Adrenaline** for the newborn in case of cardiac arrest

## Supplies:

* Delivery set
* Towels
* IV-equipment + IV fluids
* Blood pressure monitor
* Adult and newborn ambu bag with appropriate mask sizes
* Suction bulb

---

### During Transport

![](/key learning points/Manual removal of placenta/ambulance)

Observe vital signs and level of consciousness.

If the woman’s condition permits:

Keep record of all IV fluids, medications given, time of administration and the woman´s and/or newborn's condition.

---

### If in labour during transport

If pushing and superficial breathing is not enough to repress this urge, stop the transport and deliver the woman.

---

## Procedures

### Urinary catheter

### Urinary catheter - usage

Catheterize only when necessary.   
  
Emptying the bladder with a urinary catheter is indicated:

1. If a woman in labour fails to urinate spontaneously and the progress of labour is dissatisfactory, **OR**
2. Prior to applying vacuum extrator **OR**
3. In cases of postpartum haemorrhage, **AND**
4. In any servere condition such as maternal sepsis or severe preeclampsia/eclampsia to monitor the urine output. In this case, the catheter should stay in place until the condition improves (indwelling urinary catheter).

# Indwelling Urinary Catheter

![](/richtext/urine_catheter)

## Practical information

An indwelling urinary catheter is a catheter that is inserted into the bladder via the urethra and left in the bladder to drain urine.

All women in a critical condition (sepsis, severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, bleeding, shock) must have an indwelling urinary catheter, and the hourly urine output should be at least 30 ml.

If less, the underlying cause should be treated and fluid replacement considered, although not more than 80 ml per hour (oral and IV) should be given for women with preeclampsia as the risk of fluid overload and pulmonary oedema increases.

## Procedure

1. Perform handwashing prior to the procedure and apply gloves.
2. The woman should be lying on her back with knees flexed and thighs relaxed.
3. Place a blanket/sheet to cover the woman as much as possible.
4. If available, cover the woman in sterile drape.
5. Apply sterile gloves.
6. Separate the labia with one hand and expose urethral opening.
7. The area around the urethra should be cleaned twice with gauze swabs and normal saline water.
8. Lubricate catheter.
9. Insert the catheter into the urethral opening.
10. Inflate the balloon slowly by using sterile water to reach the volume recommended on the catheter.
11. **ALWAYS** ensure urine is flowing before inflating the balloon.
12. Pull back the catheter slightly until resistance is felt and attach it to the drainage system with the urine bag.
13. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.

## Removal

1. Explain the procedure to the woman.
2. Ensure privacy and have the woman placed on her back or on a toilet.
3. Perform hand hygiene and put on gloves.
4. Deflate the balloon completely or cut the catheter at the ballon inflation point to ensure the ballon is deflated.
5. Gently pull back the catheter.
6. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
7. Observe urine output after removal of catheter.
8. The woman should urinate spontanously 4-6 hours after the removal.

# Intermittent Urinary Catheter

## Practical Information

Intemittent urinary catheter is inserted at regular intervals or when urination is required but the women is not able to empty the bladder herself.

## Procedure

1. Perform handwashing prior to the procedure.
2. The woman should be lying on her back with knees flexed and thighs relaxed.
3. Place a blanket/sheet to cover the woman as much as possible.
4. If available, cover the woman in sterile drape.
5. Apply sterile gloves.
6. Separate labia with one hand and expose urethral opening.
7. The area around the urethra should be cleaned twice with gauze swabs and normal saline water.
8. Lubricate catheter.
9. Insert catheter into the urethral opening.
10. Empty the womans bladder and remove the catheter.
11. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
12. Note down the urine volume.

### Intravenous access equipment

### Intravenous access - usage

Intravenous access is used to administer fluids and drugs.

Equipment for intravenous access should be located in the delivery room.

It should be available at all health facilities for adults as well as newborn.

It includes:

**Antiseptic solution** to clean the surrounding skin, syringes, intravenous cannulas, a stasis hose/band, tapes, gauze and cannulas.

### Intravenous Access - Practical information

### Adults:

The grey (gauge 16) and green (gauge 18) cannulas have a large diameter.

Using them makes the fluid enter the veines more rapidly.

---

### Newborns:

For insertion of an intravenous cannula in the neonate select a suitable vein to place the cannula or a gauge 21 or 23 butterfly needle.

![](/richtext/pp_iv_baby_english_text)

---

### Peripheral vein:

* Identify an accessible peripheral vein, see illustration.

* An assistant should keep the position of the limb steady and should act as a tourniquet by obstructing the venous return with his or her fingers lightly closed around the limb. Alternatively use a stasis hose/band.

* Clean the surrounding skin with an **antiseptic solution** (such as **spirit**, **iodine**, **isopropyl alcohol** or **70 % alcohol solution**), then introduce the cannula into the vein and insert most of its length. Fix the catheter securely with tape. Apply a splint with the limb in an appropriate position (e.g. elbow extended, wrist slightly flexed).

![](/richtext/pp_iv_baby)

---

### Scalp vein:

These are often used in children under 2 years of age.

* Find a suitable scalp vein (usually in the midline of the forehead, the temporal area or above or behind the ear).

* Shave the area if necessary, and clean the skin with an **antiseptic solution**. The assistant should occlude the vein proximal to the site of puncture. Fill a syringe and leave the end of the tubing open. Introduce the butterfly needle as described above. Blood flowing back slowly through the tubing indicates that the needle is in the vein.

* Care should be taken not to cannulate an artery, which is recognised by palpation. If there is a pulsatile spurting of blood, withdraw the needle and apply pressure until the bleeding stops; then look for the vein.

Uncommon reactions are nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, glossitis, pseudomembraneous colitis, lowered platelets, anaemia and urticaria.

Anaphylactic shock is rare.

---

### Artesunate

### Artesunate

# Indications and Usage

Treatment of malaria.

Can be used for all types of malaria but is particularly used for plasmodium falciparum.

# Dosage and Administration

2.4 mg/kg IV (alternatively IM), repeated at 0, 12 and 24 hours.

Hereafter once daily, until oral Artesunate 2 mg/kg can be taken, to complete a total course of 7 days.

Treatment should not exceed 7 days.

# Contraindications

None. Caution should be taken at severe liver insufficiency.

# Adverse Reactions

Common adverse reactions are gastro-intestinal reactions, skin itching and rash, headache and dizziness.

Haemolytic anaemia with the need for blood transfusion is seen in up to 20% of patients treated with intravenous artesunate up to 30 days after the treatment.

Therefore it is recommended to check haemoglobin levels weekly up to 4 weeks after treatment.

Allergic reactions are rare.

---

### Betamethasone

# Indications and Usage

For lung maturation and prevention of respiratory distress of the newborn at threatening preterm labour between 24 and 34 weeks gestation.

# Dosage and Administration

12 mg IM, two doses, 24 hours apart (24 mg in total).

# Contraindications

Active untreated infections.

# Adverse Reactions

Common adverse reactions are mood changes and other mental disturbances, shortness of breath, oedema and diabetic metabolism.

---

### Chloramphenicol

# Indications and Usage

Chloramphenicol is used to treat bacterial infections sensitive to the drug.

Chloramphenicol crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk.

No known damage to the foetus has been systematically reported though knowledge is limited, and administered in late pregnancy, it may cause “grey baby syndrome” and is contraindicated in late pregnancy and also for breastfeeding women.

Therefore we do not recommend the use of Chloramphenicol for pregnant and lactating women and recommend other antibiotics instead.

---

### Ceftriaxone

# Indications and usage

Treatment of bacterial infections. Alternative to penicillin at allergy to penicillin.

# Dosage and administration

## Adults:

# Contraindications

Allergy to cephalosporins. Severe reactions to penicillin (anaphylactic reactions)

Neonates ( ≤ 28 days), hyperbilirubinaemic neonates, especially prematures, should not be treated with ceftriaxone.

In vitro studies have shown that ceftriaxone can displace bilirubin from its binding to serum albumin, leading to a possible risk of bilirubin encephalopathy in these patients.

**Ceftriaxone is contraindicated in neonates if they require (or are expected to require) treatment with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium.**

# Adverse reactions
