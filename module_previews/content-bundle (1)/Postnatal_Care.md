### Comprehensive breastfeeding

# Breastfeeding counselling

* Breastfeeding counselling should be provided to all pregnant women and mothers with newborns
* Counselling should be provided face to face, complemented telephonically if needed.
* For information on breastfeeding a small newborn - See the Low Birth Weight Module video on feeding.

![](/richtext/breastfeeding)

## Information to the mother

* Breastmilk contains all the nutrients a newborn need, and protects against infections
* Newborns should start breastfeeding within the first 1 hour of birth
* Newborns should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life
* Encourage breastfeeding at least 8 times in 24 hours, whenever the newborn wants
* Newborns should be fed responsively when they are showing signs of searching for the breast, have their mouth open, or needing comfort.
* Breastfeeding supports the newborn’s development and the maternal bonding.
* The first breastmilk is thick and yellow (colostrum) and then becomes thinner, larger in volume and whiter around day 3 after delivery.
* The more the breast is stimulated by effective feeding and expressing, the more milk it will produce.
* The newborn and the mother should be kept together.
* Do not force the newborn to take the breast.
* Do not interrupt the feeding before the newborn stops.
* While feeding, let the newborn release the breast, then offer the second breast. Do not give any other feeds or water.
* Avoid alcohol and tobacco while breastfeeding.
* Complementary feeding can start after 6 months while continuing to breastfeed for up to 2 years.

---

## Effective positioning and attachment

Guide the woman in the following steps:

**Positioning the newborn**

* Make sure the newborn’s head and body are in a straight line
* Make sure the newborn is facing the breast, the newborn’s nose is opposite the nipple
* Place the newborn skin-to-skin
* Support the newborn’s whole body, not just the neck and shoulders

**Initiating attachment**

* The newborn’s lips should touch the nipple
* Wait until the newborn’s mouth is opened wide
* Shape the breast and nipple to help the newborn with correct attachment: Place four fingers below and the thumb on top of the breast.
* Move the newborn quickly onto the breast, making sure the lower lip is turned outward.

**Signs of effective attachment**

* More of the areola is visible above the newborn’s mouth compared to below
* Mouth is wide open
* Lower lip turned outwards
* Newborn’s chin is touching the breast
* No clicking sounds are heard when the newborn is sucking
* Newborn’s cheeks are full, not pulled in
* Breastfeeding should not be painful throughout
* Nipples are not misshapen after a feed

**Signs of effective suckling:**

* Slow, deep sucks
* Occasional pausing
* Swallowing sounds when the newborn feeds

If the attachment or the sucking is ineffective, take the newborn off the breast and try again. Then reassess.

If the woman is experiencing breast engorgement, express a small amount of breast milk before breastfeeding to soften nipple area making it is easier for the newborn to attach.

![](/richtext/effective_positioning)

## Signs of the newborn receiving enough milk

* Newborn is sucking and swallowing the milk effectively
* When satisfied with the feed, the newborn comes off the breast on their own.
* Weight loss is less than 10% in the first week of life
* Newborn gains at least 160g in the following weeks or a minimum of 300g in the first month
* Newborn wets every day approximately as frequently as the newborn is feeding
* Newborn’s stool is changing from dark to light brown or yellow by day 3
* Newborn has alert and active periods throughout the day.

---

## The HIV infected mother

**Breastfeeding counselling for HIV-infected mothers:**

* Explain the risks of HIV transmission both when breastfeeding and not breastfeeding
* Three out of 20 babies born to HIV-infected mothers without anti-retroviral therapy (ART) will become infected while breastfeeding.
* The risk of infection is significantly reduced when the mother receives ART. If she is on ART, she should be supported in breastfeeding.
* This risk is reduced further by effective breastfeeding positioning and attachment, and safe practices.
* Mastitis and sore nipples increase the risk of transmission.
* Avoid using infant formula if possible.

Recommend that the mother returns immediately if:

* She has any breastfeeding complications
* The newborn has any difficulty feeding

If she decides to stop breastfeeding, she must stop gradually within one month while taking ART. Depending on her ART regimen, she will either continue taking ART (for life) or will stop ART one week after breastfeeding is fully stopped.

If HIV status is unknown, counsel on the importance of HIV testing and where to get tested. Encourage exclusive breastfeeding with effective positioning and attachment.

# Lactation complications

![](/richtext/ineffective_sucking)

## Sore or cracked nipples

**Causes:**

* Ineffective positioning and attachment (latch)
* Tongue tie
* Thrush

**Treat and advise:**

Encourage the mother to continue breastfeeding.

Teach correct positioning and attachment Rubbing breastmilk on nipples and let them air dry can support the healing.

Reassess after 2 feeds (or 1 day). If not better, teach the mother how to express breast milk from the affected breast and feed by cup, and continue breastfeeding on the healthy breast.

If tongue tie or thrush, refer to higher centre.

![](/richtext/mastitis)

## Breast engorgement

**Signs:**

* Both breasts are swollen, shiny and patchy red
* Temperature >38°C
* Newborn not well attached '
* Not yet breastfeeding

**Causes:**

* Inadequate removal of milk from the breast, either from separation of the mother and newborn, restrictive feeding practices and/or ineffective sucking or, less common, over production.

**Treat and advise:**

* Encourage continued breastfeeding
* Teach correct positioning and attachment
* Advise to feed more frequently
* Reassess after 2 feeds (or 1 day). If not getting better, teach the mother how to massage the breast and to express breast milk before feed to relieve the pain
* Give paracetamol for the pain
* Suggest the use of warm or cold breast compresses according to the woman’s preferences.

![](/richtext/breast_engorgement)

## Mastitis

**Signs:**

* Parts of breast are painful, swollen and red
* Nipple discharge (white or having streaks of blood)
* Temperature > 38°C
* Flu-like symptoms

**Causes:**

* Untreated engorgement and build-up of milk

**Treat and advise:**

* Massage the breast to ease obstructed milk ducts
* Stroking from the lumpy/sore area towards the nipple
* Give cloxacillin 500 mg every 6 hours for 10 days
* Reassess in 2 days. If no improvement or worse, refer to hospital.
* If the mother is HIV-infected, let her breastfeed on the healthy breast. Express milk from the affected breast and discard until no fever
* Give paracetamol for the pain
* Warm damp compress
* Rest and hydration

# Alternative feeding methods

## Expressed breast milk

You can feed the newborn with expressed breast milk if the sucking is not well established or there are other feeding difficulties.

To express milk from the breast can also relieve engorgement and help the newborn to attach or drain the breast when there is mastitis or abscess.

![](/richtext/alternative_feeding_methods)

**Teach the mother how to express:**

* Wash hands thoroughly
* Sit or stand comfortably and hold a clean container under the breast.
* Put the first finger and thumb on either side of areola and press slightly inwards towards the breast
* Express on one breast until the milk flow slows. Then express the breastmilk from the other breast
* Express for at least 20-30 min. and feed the newborn immediately afterwards. Express milk at least 8 times in 24 hours, every 2-3 hours

**If the milk does not flow well:**

* Apply warm compresses
* Encourage partner/a relative to massage the back and neck before expressing
* Teach breast and nipple massage

---

## The newborn can either be fed by cup or directly into the newborn’s mouth.

**Expressing milk into the newborn’s mouth**

* Hold the newborn skin to skin with the mouth close to the nipple, and express until drops of milk appear
* Wait until the newborn is alert and opens the mouth and eyes or stimulate lightly
* Let the newborn smell and lick the nipple and try to suck
* Let some milk fall into the newborn’s mouth
* Wait until the newborn swallows and then express more drops of milk
* Repeat until the newborn has had enough and closes the mouth
* Check weight to make sure the newborn is feeding adequately

**Feeding the newborn by cup**

* The newborn should sit semi-upright on the lap
* Hold the cup of the milk to the newborn’s lips, and rest on the lower lip
* You should not pour the milk into the newborn’s mouth, but wait until the newborn becomes alert, opens its mouth and starts to feed.
* The mouth closes when the newborn has had enough
* Wash the cup with water and soap after each feed
* If the quantity taken is small, feed often
* Monitor weight gain to know the sufficiency of milk intake
* Feed with expressed milk. If not available, use donated, heat-treated breast milk or home-made or commercial formula

![](/richtext/milk_by_cup)

**Quantity of feed**

* Start with 80 ml/kg body weight per day for day 1
* Increase total volume by 10-20 ml/kg/day until newborn takes 150 ml/kg/day
* Divide total into 8 feeds
* Check newborn’s 24-hour intake. Size of individual feeds may vary
* Continue until the newborn takes the required quantity

**Storage and treating expressed milk**

* Store expressed milk in a clean and safe place at room temperature for 8 hours
* Expressed milk can be refrigerated for 24 hours

# Support a mother who is not breastfeeding

## If the newborn dies, is stillborn or the mother chooses replacement feeding, you should:

* Tell that breasts may be uncomfortable for a while
* Avoid stimulating the breasts
* Support breasts with a well-fitting bra or cloth. Do not bind tightly
* Apply compress – warm or cold as per preference to reduce swelling
* Teach to express milk just enough to relieve discomfort. Don’t empty the breast.
* Relieve pain with analgesic – paracetamol or ibuprofen
* Recommend seeking care if breasts become painful, swollen, red, if she feels ill or temperature is > 38.0°C
