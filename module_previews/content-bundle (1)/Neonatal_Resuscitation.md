### Neonatal resuscitation

The Golden Minute

![](/richtext/golden_minute)

By one minute of age all newborns should be able to breathe on their own or should be ventilated with a bag and a mask.

Immediately after the delivery dry the newborn thoroughly with a towel and assess. Remove wet towels and cover to keep it warm.

If thick meconium: clear mouth and nose and suction airways before ventilating.  
Stimulate the newborn thoroughly by rubbing it’s back.

If the newborn is NOT crying or breathing well after drying, is limp and does not move and has bluish or pale colour, you need to proceed to neonatal resuscitation immediately.

Follow your facility’s routine for when to cut or clamp the umbilical cord and do the following:

**CALL FOR HELP**

---

### Airway and Breathing

Position the head in "sniffing" position.

Position mask so it covers mouth and nose, use the “C” and “E” grip.

Give ventilation breaths at a rate of 40 breaths per minute

Observe that chest is rising.

If not rising, check the positioning of the head and the mask.

Consider performing jawthrust.

Continue ventilation breaths.

Oxygen supplement is not necessary.

---

If breathing is still insufficient or heart rate is below 100 beats per minute;

Continue ventilation breaths at a rate of 40 breaths/minute.

Observe chest is rising.

Assess breathing continuously and at least every minute. Check heart rate every 3-5 minutes.

If breathing is still insufficient or heart rate is below 100 continue ventilation breaths until spontaneous breathing and normal heart rate.

If heart rate is below 60 start chest compressions.

### When to stop resuscitation

If the newborn is not breathing and has no pulse after 10 min of EFFECTIVE ventilation or a heart rate below 60 bpm for more than 20 minutes you may take the difficult decision to stop the resuscitation.

Explain gently to the mother, that the newborn unfortunately did not survive. Provide emotional support to the family.

### Safe Oxygen Therapy

### Safe oxygen therapy

Hypoxaemia means low levels of oxygen in the blood and is a life-threatening condition. It occurs in neonates with birth asphyxia and respiratory distress syndrome as well as infections such as severe pneumonia and sepsis.

The normal range of SpO2 is 94-100%. It may take an hour after delivery for oxygen saturation to reach >90% for newborns.

Use pulse oximetry whenever possible. It is recommended for determining the presence of hypoxaemia and for guiding administration of oxygen therapy to neonates, infants, and children. Give oxygen if:

* Oxygen saturation <90%

If pulse oximetry is not available, the following clinical signs could be used to determine use of oxygen therapy.

* Central cyanosis
* Nasal flaring
* Inability to drink or feed (when due to respiratory distress)
* Grunting with every breath
* Depressed mental state is drowsy and/or lethargic

In some situations, and depending on the overall clinical condition, children with the following less-specific signs may also need oxygen:

* Severe lower chest wall indrawing
* Respiratory rate >70/min (age 2 months to 5 years)
* Head nodding (i.e. a nodding movement of the head in synch with respiration and indicating severe respiratory distress)

---

### Oxygen delivery methods

Nasal prongs are the preferred method of delivering oxygen to infants and children   
<5 years of age with hypoxaemia who require oxygen therapy.

Where nasal prongs are not available, nasal or nasopharyngeal catheters can be used as alternative delivery methods. Face masks and head boxes are not recommended.

Standard flow rates for oxygen through nasal prongs or nasal catheters are:

* 0.5-1 L/min for neonates. Maximum flow rate without humidification is 1/min in neonates.
* 1-2 L/min for infants
* 1-4 L/min for older children

---

### Monitoring

Administration of oxygen therapy should be guided by pulse oximetry, when available.

The normal oxygen level for newborns in the first hours of life is >88%.

In preterm infants born at <32 weeks’ gestation, oxygen levels should be maintained between 88% and 95% and NOT above 95%, in order to avoid eye damage (retinopathy).

Oxygen therapy should be discontinued in a clinically stable child once oxygen saturation remains stable above the recommended level of 90% for at least 15 min in room air.

Do not discharge the child until their oxygen levels have been stable at >90% for at least 24 hours AND until all danger signs have resolved.

### Fluid management of newborns

The total daily volume of fluids (ml/kg/day) required by a newborn is determined by weight and day of life.

The total daily volume of fluids is spread over 24 hours. It is composed of either enteral only, intravenous only or a combination of the two.

The maximum fluid volume in intravenous fluids for a newborn is 150 ml/kg/day.

The usual maximum oral intake for a newborn is 180 ml/kg/day.

The reference weight is the birthweight until the birth weight is exceeded.

---

Total daily fluid requirements in ml/kg/day (accumulated oral, nasogastric tube, IV)

![](/richtext/daily_fluid_requirements)

---

If very low birth weight or not able to tolerate oral feeds give IV **10% glucose solution**.

After the first two days of life change to **half saline** or **5% dextrose**.

Reintroduce expressed breast milk feeds slowly, and gradually increase by 1-2 ml per feed each day.

If IV fluids are given, reduce the rate as the volume of oral or gastric milk feeds increases and when sucking well at the breast and gaining weight reduce the cup or gastric tube feeds.

---

### Emergency Referral for Newborn

### Emergency referral for newborns

Emergency!

Do not refer if emergency is not controlled!

After emergency management and when in a stable condition, discuss decision of referral with the mother and relatives.

If a newborn is in need of referral; give the recommended antibiotics prior to referral.

Before and during referral it is important to keep the newborn warm. Use either skin-to-skin contact or wrap in a soft, dry, cloth and blanket, ensuring that the head is covered.

Initiate breastfeeding or provide alternative breastmilk feeding.

If in a facility where there is neonatal ICU refer the newborn after 5 minutes of ventilation with bag and mask. Continue ventilation while referring the newborn. If referral is impossible, continue neonatal resuscitation. See Action Card Neonatal Resuscitation.

Inform the referral center.

Accompany the mother with the newborn.

It is crucial that the newborn is accompanied by a health worker who is trained in managing an emergency situation.

Quickly organize transport and possible financial aid.

Consider to bring a relative who can donate blood.

Common adverse reactions are diarrhoea and skin rash.

Uncommon reactions are nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, glossitis, pseudomembraneous colitis, lowered platelets, anaemia and urticaria.

Anaphylactic shock is rare.

---

### Ceftriaxone

# Indications and usage

Treatment of bacterial infections. Alternative to penicillin at allergy to penicillin.

# Dosage and administration

## Adults:

4 grams IV first dose (max: 4 g/day)   
1-2 g IV or IM once daily.

## Newborns:

### Phenobarbital

# Indications and Usage

Phenobarbital is in a group of drugs called barbiturates.

Phenobarbital slows the activity of the brain and nervous system.

Phenobarbital is used to treat or prevent seizures.

Observe closely for apnoea and always have a bag-mask available to ventilate the child if necessary.

Be aware that the plasma half-life for Phenobarbital in children and newborns (less than 48 hours old) ranges between 60 to 180 hours with a mean of 110 hours.

# Dosage and Administration

## Newborns:

For seizures:

Start treatment with loading dose 20 mg/kg IV over 15 minutes or as a single dose IM if IV access is not established.

If convulsions do not stop within 30 minutes give further dose of phenobarbital 10 mg/kg IV slowly over 5 minutes (or IM).

If necessary repeat after another 30 minutes.

Maximum dose is of 40 mg/kg body weight.

If needed continue Phenobarbital at maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg IV, IM, or orally per day.

**CAUTION:**

Diazepam given in addition to phenobarbital will increase the risk of circulatory collapse and respiratory failure.

# Contraindications

Phenobarbital is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to barbiturates, in patients with a history of manifest or latent porphyria, and in patients with marked impairment of liver function or respiratory disease in which dyspnoea or obstruction is evident.

# Adverse reactions

Common:

The most common adverse reaction, estimated to occur at a rate of 1 to 3 patients per 100, are disorders of the nervous system such as drowsiness or sleepiness.

Less common:

Adverse reactions estimated to occur at a rate of less than 1 in 100 patients are listed below, grouped by organ system and by decreasing order of occurrence:

Nervous System:

Agitation, confusion, hyperkinesia, ataxia, CNS depression, nightmares, nervousness, psychiatric disturbance, hallucinations, insomnia, anxiety, dizziness, abnormality in thinking.

Respiratory System:

Hypoventilation, apnoea.

Cardiovascular System:

Bradycardia, hypotension, syncope.
