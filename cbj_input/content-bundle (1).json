                    "content": "<h1>Introduction & Aim</h1><p>Welcome to the Safe Delivery App! This App is designed as an aid for skilled birth attendants to manage complications during pregnancy, childbirth, and the first month after birth for both women and newborns.</p><p>Life threatening complications can happen to any pregnant woman, and often occur unexpectedly in “low risk pregnancies.”</p><p>Every year almost three million babies are stillborn, and many die within the first month of life. Additionally, more than a quarter of a million women die due to complications during pregnancy and child birth. Assuring the quality of basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care (BEmONC) has proven to be of key importance to reduce death and disability of mothers and newborns.</p><p><strong>The aim of the Safe Delivery App is to make you better prepared to prevent, detect, and manage life threatening complications to mothers and newborns.</strong></p><p>The App has several functions that we hope you will find useful.</p><h1>Videos</h1><p>The United Nations established seven BEmONC signal functions that every skilled birth attendant must be able to perform. Within the App, these signal functions are translated into videos with instructions on how to:</p><ol><li>Stop post-partum haemorrhage (PPH)</li><li>Remove a retained placenta</li><li>Manage maternal sepsis </li><li>Manage hypertensive disorders</li><li>Manage prolonged labour, including how to perform vacuum-assisted delivery</li><li>Perform manual vacuum aspiration (MVA)</li><li>Resuscitate a newborn</li></ol><p>On top of this, The Safe Delivery App includes additional videos on different obstetric and preventative topics.<br></p><p>The videos last about seven-ten minutes and can be viewed either in full or by chapter.</p><h1>Action Cards</h1><p>In an emergency situation, you may not have time to review a video. </p><p>Therefore, we have created “Action Cards” with essential recommendations for management of the seven BEmONC signal functions and early neonatal management.</p><h1>Essential Drugs</h1><p>The SDA also includes a comprehensive drug list which contains useful information on the various drugs needed to perform BEmONC. Each topic area also includes a specific drug list. </p><p>Drugs are listed alphabetically along with indications for use, dosage, when the drugs should <strong>not </strong>be used (contraindications), and adverse reactions.</p><p>The drug list can also help with restocking your pharmacy. We recommend that you review the drug list to make sure your facility has the essential drugs needed for BEmONC. </p><h1>Procedures</h1><p>In this section, certain procedures are described step-by-step. For example: \"how to insert a nasogastric tube,\" or \"how to clean a manual vacuum aspirator.\"</p><h1>Push Messages</h1><p>These will appear on your phone occasionally to remind you to revisit the Safe Delivery App. They will guide you to interesting parts of the App you may want to explore!</p><h1>Learning Platform</h1><p>The Safe Delivery App Learning Platform will allow the user to enter into his or her own personalised Learning Journey and further improve his or her knowledge of the content provided on the Safe Delivery App.</p><p>The Learning platform focuses on the clinical content found within the Safe Delivery App and provides learning based on key elements within the themes presented in the App: the 7 BEmONC Signal Functions and the additional obstetric and preventative topics.</p><p>Each theme has 3 levels and each of these levels consist of 12 questions, which must be answered correctly in order to proceed to the next level.</p><p>There are three types of questions which may be answered in three different formats: <br>1) by choosing 1 correct answer when you see the symbol ◯<br>2) by choosing more correct answers when you see the symbol ☐ and <br>3) by arranging cards in the right order.</p><p>As a user you can create a profile and you have the possibility to create more than one user profile on the device. </p><p>A user profile can be created both online and offline on the device.</p><p>When creating an online user you will have the possibility to recover you password and thereby your progress on the learning platform if you change your phone or have to re-install the Safe Delivery App. </p><p>Be aware that deleting the app from your phone will cause your progress to be lost – unless you log out of the platform before doing so.</p><h1>The Safe Delivery Champion Certificate:</h1><p>The certification test will be available to you immediately after you have passed all themes in the Safe Delivery App Learning Platform with 3 stars in each level.</p><p>The certification test is a comprehensive test of knowledge of performing the clinical procedures described in the Safe Delivery App. The certification test consists of 15 cases with 1-7 questions for each – a total of 53 questions.</p><p>Once you have completed and passed the test you will receive a certificate with your new status as a Safe Delivery Champion. </p><p>The certificate will last for a year, and you can receive a print-out version of the certificate by email. </p><hr><p><strong><span color='highlighted'>Thank you very much for downloading the Safe Delivery App.</strong></span></p><p><strong><span color='highlighted'>We are full of admiration for your work and the lives you safe!</strong></span></p>"
